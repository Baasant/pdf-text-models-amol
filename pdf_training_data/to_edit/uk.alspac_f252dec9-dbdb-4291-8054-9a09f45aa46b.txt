This questionnaire asks about your child now she is 3 years old.We are
interested to know about her health and behaviour and how she gets on
with other children.Your answers will help us to understand the
developing child and to identify problems that children and their
parents have.

This questionnaire is like the other questionnaires you have received.To
answer simply tick the box which best describes your child or your
child's situation.Again some questions will seem similar but they are
not the same.Please answer all questions that you can.If you cannot
answer any question or if they do not apply to you please put a line
through them.There are no right or wrong answers.Please just describe
what happens in your situation.You may make additional comments at the
end.All answers are confidential.
