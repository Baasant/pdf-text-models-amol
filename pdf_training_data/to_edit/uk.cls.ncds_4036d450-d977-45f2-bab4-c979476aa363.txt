which have been written about the information which
you, your parents, your teachers and your doctors
gave to us when you were seven and when you were
eleven. Already your help is benefiting younger
childran and will continue to do so for many years

In the next few pages you will be asked about
yourself, your schoo! and what you expect to be
doing in the next few years. It is, of course, very
important that the answers you give us really do tall
us your ideas about things. so please give as accurate
and open an answer as you can

You may feei that some of your answers are personal
This is why you have been given an envelope with
this questionnaire. As soon as you have answered all
the questions you should put this form inside the

about.

Secondly, there are those questions where there are
a number of possible answers and we have written
these with a number against each one. All you have

Thirdly, some questions have a box or boxes by them
in which you have to write a number, or numbers

You may sometimes feel that you have not been able
to say all that you want just by ringing or writing a
number, If so. please add any comment you want
