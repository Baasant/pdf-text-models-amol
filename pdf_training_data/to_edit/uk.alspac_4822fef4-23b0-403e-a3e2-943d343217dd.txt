INTRODUCTION

You are receiving this questionnaire because you are the father or father
figure of a young person in our study.

Some questions may seem very similar to each other; this is because the
combination of answers gives a clearer picture than one single answer. There
may be questions that seem a bit strange and are not applicable to you
because they are concerned with specific feelings or problems.

We would be very grateful if you would try to answer all the questions, but
we understand that there may be questions that you either prefer not to
answer or are unable to answer. We understand that some of the questions
are of a sensitive nature, please remember that your answers are confidential
and anonymous.

We appreciate the time and effort required to complete the questionnaire and
thank you for your continued support. The success of the study is entirely
dependent on the support and goodwill of the participating families
