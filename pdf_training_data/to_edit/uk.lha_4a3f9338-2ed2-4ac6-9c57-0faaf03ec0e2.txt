If a child has moved to another school this form should be returned
to the Director of Education and not sent directly to the new school.

 

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey of the health, growth and development of children. With
the help of his parents and of health visitors, school nurses and teachers, a detailed account has been obtained of
his health and development during the past 13 years. The survey children come from all types of home and are
attending all types of school both independent and Local Authority. During the past 13 years only 6 per cent have
been lost and the value of this inquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child.

Some of the most valuable information obtained during the primary school period was given by the teachers,
and the present questions are modelled on those that were particularly successful in the past. A large number relate
to behaviour, and in these the object is to find out how well the child is adjusted to school and work. We are just
as interested in those who are doing very well as in those who are doing badly.

All information given will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility that the name of any child
or school will appear in any report.

CHILDREN’S QUESTIONNAIRE

You will find inside this questionnaire another one (on yellow paper) for the child himself to fill in. This should
be administered in the same way as an intelligence test; after making sure the child fully understands the instructions
get him to move rapidly through the items. When he has finished please make sure he has answered all the questions
and then return both questionnaires, folded one inside the other, to the Director of Education.
