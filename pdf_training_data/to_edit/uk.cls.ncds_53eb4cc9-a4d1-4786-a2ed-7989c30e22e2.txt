INTRODUCTORY NOTES

 

 

The Purpose of the Study

The child to whom this questionnaire refers is onc of the 17,000 children born during the week 3rd to 9th March, 1958,
in England, Scotland and Wales.

Shortly after their birth, all these children were the subject of a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances
relating to the mother and child, the pregnancy and the birth. The results of this study published in the Perinatal
Mortality Survey have already had a world-wide influence, and it is hoped that the many doctors and midwives who were
involved feel that their cfforts have been fully justified.

The National Child Development Study is a logical extension of the original investigation to the growing child. Not
only is there the necd to assess the present physical, educational and cmotional status of the child population, but for the
first time there is an opportunity to relate these assessments Co the existing obstctric and social data of this large national
sample.

 

  

     




2

Considerable interest is already focussed on the major handicaps of childhood, but much remains to be discovered
about the true incidence of these conditions und their astiology. Even less is known of the incidence and cause uf minor
disabilities, ional maladjustments and ed ional handicar This study will throw some light on their occur:
ence amongst children considered “at risk” of devcloping handicapping conditions.

 

This study will also reveal the numbers of children who have been exposed to such predisposing factors, but who are
nevertheless developing normally,

The Scope of the Investigation

The Study is based on information gathered trom three sources.

(1) The school is assessing the child's cdlucational Progress and social adjustment and is applying some attainment
tests. This aspect of the investigation is being undertaken by the Local Education Department.

(ti) The mother of the child is interviewed by a Health Visitor (in most instances) who completes a Parentat
Questionnaire concerning the child's carty life and cnvironment. Details of illnesses, operations and a full medical history
are included in this questionnaire, and on completion it will be passed on to the doctor for reference during his examination
of the child.

(ii) The Medical Questionnaire comprises a medical history and examination, tests of vision, speech and hearing,
physical measurements and a urine test. It is also hoped that an Audiogram will be obtained, at a time convenient to the
School Health Department.

NOTES ON THE MEDICAL QUESTIONNAIRE

The form of this questionnaire has been determined by the need to utilise modern methods of handling a large
volume of data. Except where stated otherwise, cach question is answered by putting a ring round the appropriate
number in each box.

Examples of Scoring:

The following order of completion is Suggesicd as the most practical:

With the child dressed: (1) Front page.
(2) Medical History. N.B.: Since these questions, on pages 4, 6, 8, are identical with
pages 16, 17, 18 of the Parental Questionnaire. It is not necessary for the doctor to (ake
a second medical history if the latter is to hand and has been unswered to his satisfaction.
(3) Vision, Specch and Hearing tests.
(4) Uristix urine test.

With the child undressed: (5) Height, Weight and Head circumference.

(6) Medical examination.

(7) Completion of questionnaire.

VISION TEST (Card 6 - applies for uncoded)

28. Notes: (1) Test at exactly 20 ft. with a standard Snellen chart of block capitals without seriphs (i.c. WX, not VX).
(2) Hang the chart in a good light, level with the child’s eyes, and free from glire.
G3

Please occlude the other eye efficiently without pressing on the eyeball.
(4) If the child does not know his letters and also gives an unsatisfactory response with the “E test", try again
with the Snellen chart asking the child to “draw the fetters in the air”. If this fails, try a picture card.

(This order of procedure is recommended to avoid diagnosing a child with a spatio-visual difficulty as having
a visual defect),
