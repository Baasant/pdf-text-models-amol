 MY   LITTLE   BOY

Children grow so quickly, and change so much. This questionnaire asks
about any accidents or problems your son may have had now that he is
two years old, what he has been eating and drinking, his temperament
and the way he may be beginning to understand the world about him.

It is like the other questionnaires you have received. To answer simply
tick the box which best describes your son or his situation. Again
some questions will seem similar but they are not the same. Please
answer all questions that you can. If you cannot answer a question or
if it does not apply to you please put a line through it. There are no
right or wrong answers. Please just describe what happens in your
situation. You may make additional comments at the end. All answers
are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
