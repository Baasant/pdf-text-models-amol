The Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Walking Impairment Questionnaire 

Overview: Regensteiner et al developed a questionnaire for evaluating walking impairment in patients 
with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This can be used to identify patients with significant impairment 
and to monitor effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The authors are from the Universities of 
Colorado and Rochester. 

Parameters: 

(1) difficulty walking a distance during the past month 

(2) difficulty walking at a certain speed during the past month 

(3) symptoms associated with walking impairment 

Walking Distance Degree of Difficulty Points 

walking indoors (around the house) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 50 feet no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 150 feet (0.5 blocks) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 300 feet (1.0 blocks) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 600 feet (2.0 blocks) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 



walking 900 feet (3.0 blocks) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 1500 feet (5.0 blocks) or more no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking distance score = 

= (20 * (points for walking indoors)) + (50 * (points for walking 50 feet)) + (150 * (points for walking 150 
feet)) + (300 * (points for walking 300 feet)) + (600 * (points for walking 600 feet)) + (900 * (points for 
walking 900 feet)) + (1500 * (points for walking 1500 feet))  

where: each distance is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of 
difficulty. 

fraction of maximal walking distance score = (walking distance score) / 6060  

Walking Speed Degree of Difficulty Points 

walking 1 block slowly? (about 1.5 mph) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 1 block at an average speed? (about 
2.0 mph) 

no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking 1 block quickly? (about 3.0 mph) no 3 

  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

running or jogging 1 block? (about 5.0 mph) no 3 



  some 2 

  much 1 

  did not do 0 

walking speed score = (1.5 * (points for walking slowly)) + (2 * (points for walking at average speed)) + 
(3 * (points for walking quickly)) + (5 * (points for running or jogging))  

where: each speed is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of difficulty. 

fraction of maximal walking speed score = (walking speed score) / 34.5  

Symptoms of Walking Impairment Degree of Difficulty Points 

pain or aching in your calves? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

pain or aching in your thighs? no 3 

  slight 2

pain stiffness or aching in your joints (knees or hips)? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

pain or discomfort in your chest? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

weakness in one or both of your legs? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 



shortness of breath? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

heart palpitations? no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

other problems? (please list) no 3 

  slight 2 

  some 1 

  much 0 

where: 

• A total symptom score was not calculated. This was the questions "were not a ranked 
series." 

• The data was presented as "a percentage of the maximal score possible of 4.0." 

Interpretation: 

• minimum walking distance score: 0 

• maximum walking distance score: 34.5 

• minimum walking speed score: 0 

• maximum walking speed score: 6 60  

• The score can be used to compare impairment before and after vascular surgery. 

Performance: 

• Changes in questionnaire scores correlated with some measurements of treadmill 
performance. 

• Retesting in an untreated control group showed similar scores after 12 weeks.
