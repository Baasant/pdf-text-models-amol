PRESENT STATE EXAMINATION

1. INTRODUCTION and 2. HEALTH, WORRYING, TENSION

Now I should like to get some idea of how you have been getting along in the past month, how your general health has been and how
you have been feeling about things. Some of the things that I shall ask may not apply to you; I am just making sure that everything has

been mentioned.

** Most people have some sort of worry or trouble from time to time. What sort of things do you worry about?

 

RECORD THE MAIN PROBLEMS SPONTANEOUSLY MENTIONED AND THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE
SUBJECT’S REPLY VERBATIM.

Means of exploration if subject gives inadequate information:

If subject’s statement too brief: Can you tell me more about that?

If subject has no more to add: What else has been troubling you?

If statements are difficult to understand: Can you explain what you mean by... ?
If subject is vague: Could you give me an example of... ?

** What is it like when you worry?

 

(What sort of state of mind do you get into?)
(Do unpleasant thoughts constantly go round and round in your mind?)
(Can you stop them by turning your attention to something else?)

RATE WORRYING (4)
A round of painful thought which cannot be stopped and is out of proportion to the subject worried about.
