This questionnaire is for the study child’s mother or person 
taking the role of mother. 

It will help us to catch up with some current problems you 
may have, as well as some features of your lifestyle. 

Some of the questions we are asking may seem remote from 
the health of your study child, but the answers will help us 
to plan for studying the changes that will be occurring in 

our children as they develop, and how these may be passed 
down from one generation to the next. 

 

 
 

To answer simply tick the box which is most accurate in 
your opinion. 

If you do not want to answer a question or if it does not 
apply to you, put a line through it. There are no good or bad 

answers. Just tell us what is true for you. 
 

THANK YOU FOR YOU HELP
