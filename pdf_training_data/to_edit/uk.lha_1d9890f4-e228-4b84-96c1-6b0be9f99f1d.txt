CLINIC STUDY 2008-10 

 

Pre-Assessment Booklet 
  

This is a questionnaire about your lifestyle and some aspects of your health. We will use the information 

you provide to help us understand the measurements to be taken. We would like you to fill in this 

questionnaire before you arrive at the clinic because the time at the clinic will be taken up with the health 

examination. Alternatively if the nurse is visiting you at home, please fill in the questionnaire before she 

comes. 

 

When completing the questionnaire please use a pen to put a tick in the appropriate box or to circle the 

appropriate response to each question (i.e. Yes   1 ) and provide further details where requested either in 

boxes or in the space provided.  

 

Some questions don’t apply to everybody. Where you should skip questions that do not apply to you it  

tells you which question to go to next at the side of the answer you have circled (i.e. → go to Q2). 

Otherwise please continue through each question in turn. 

 

All information you give us will be treated in the strictest confidence. If you have any queries do not  

hesitate to telephone us on 020 7670 5702. 

 

When you have finished filling in the questionnaire, please keep it safely and bring it with you when you 

come to visit us at the clinic. Thank you very much for your time and co-operation. 

 

 

Please enter the date you completed this questionnaire:
