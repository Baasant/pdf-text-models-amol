DIET DIARY
1999

 

We would be grateful if you could keep this diary of
everything you eat or drink over the next 6 days. This is a
very useful and important part of the Survey, and will help
us to understand the effects of diet on long-term health.
The nurse will fill in the first day up to now with you and
then leave you to complete it and the following five days on
your own. Some details of how to do this are on the first
few pages.

When the last day has been filled in, please complete the
questions on the last page and post the booklet back to us
in the envelope provided. You do not need a stamp.

 

 

 




Details of how to use the diary

Each day is divided into sections, from first thing in the morning to late
evening. Please treat each day separately. Write in the name of all food
and drink taken (including water), a description and the amount (even if
just a mouthful), for each part of the day. If nothing was eaten or drunk
during a part of the day, please draw a line through that section. Please
record everything at the time of eating, NOT from memory at the end of the
day.

Overleaf is a list of popular foods and drinks with descriptions so that we can
tell what it is made of and how much you had. There are also some notes
on recording made-up dishes and take-away foods. Please give as much
detail as you can.

Where possible, please always state what sort of fat or oil was used for
spreading, baking or frying.

For some foods, you may find it easier to describe how much you had by
comparing it to one of the pictures. Please write the number and letter of
the picture which best describes the amount you have eaten, eg. 6C.

Many packet foods have weights printed on them, so please use these and
give brand names whenever possible. Stick the descriptive parts of the
wrappers of ready-made packaged meals in your diary, if you can.

At the end of each day, there is a list of snacks and drinks that can easily be
forgotten. /f not already mentioned in some other part of the day, please
write any extra items in here.

Please name any vitamin or other supplements if you had any, giving brand
details, and enclosing label(s) if possible.

The general questions at the end of the book will help us identify the foods
you usually use.

It is very important that you do not adjust what you eat
and drink just because you are keeping a record. Please
stick to your usual diet.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELF
