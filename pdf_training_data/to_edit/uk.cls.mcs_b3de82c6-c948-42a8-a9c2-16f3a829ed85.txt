ABOUT THIS BOOKLET OF QUESTIONS 
 
 
 

PLEASE READ THIS PAGE AND THE NEXT PAGE BEFORE YOU START 
 
 

 
 
 

The questions in this booklet are about different things in your life. They are for you to read and 

answer on your own. We hope that you find the questions interesting and enjoy answering 

them.  

 

Please try to answer all of the questions. Read everything carefully and take your time to 

answer each question as honestly and accurately as you can. There are no right or wrong 

answers. It is not a test. We just want to find out what you think about things.  

 

Not all the questions will be about things that you have done. For the survey to be accurate, it is 

important that all children, even those who have done these things, answer honestly. 

 

The interviewer will give you an envelope when they give you this booklet. When you get to the 

end, please put the booklet inside the envelope, seal it and then hand it back to the interviewer. 

The interviewer will not look at your answers or tell them to anyone else.  

 

You do not have to show or tell your answers to anyone, including your parent(s). Your name 

and address are not on this booklet so no-one who sees it will know whose answers they 

are. If you come to a question that you don’t want to answer you can skip it. If you come to a 

question that you can’t answer, you can skip it or tick the ‘Don’t know’ box if there is one.  

 

If there are any words that you can’t read or don’t understand, please ask the interviewer to 

explain them to you.  

 

If you find it difficult to read and answer the questions on your own, please tell the interviewer 

and they will help you. They can also give you some headphones and the questions will be read 

out to you.
