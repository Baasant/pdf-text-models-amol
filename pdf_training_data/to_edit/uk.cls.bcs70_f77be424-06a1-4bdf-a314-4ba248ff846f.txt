ACADEMIC ASSESSMENT OF PUPIL

Q6. We would like you to grade the pupil on his/her ACTUAL PERFORMANCE and UNDERLYING ABILITY, ¢

with other youngsters of a similar age.

Ompared

Please choose the grade in each of the two columns. which, in your judgement, most closely reflects the pupil's

standing, for (a) performance and (b}) ability.

Performance alone may not be an accurate measure of underlying ability. Some pupils underperform because of
poor motivation or emotional difficulties, while by dint of hard work manage to achieve a grade above what might

be expected given their natural talents.
