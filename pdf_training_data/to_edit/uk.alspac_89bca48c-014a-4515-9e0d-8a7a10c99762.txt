THE  BABY  AND  ME
(PARTNER'S QUESTIONNAIRE)

This questionnaire asks about your health and lifestyle now that the baby
is over 6 months old.

Some questions may seem similar, but they are not the same. Others will
be the same as you have answered in earlier questionnaires. This is so
that we can see how things may have changed for you.

All the answers you give are confidential. We would be grateful if you
would help us by answering as many of these questions as possible, but
if there is any question you do not want to answer that is fine.Just
leave it blank.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP
