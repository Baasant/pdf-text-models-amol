This questionnaire is for completion by the study young person.

In answering these questions you will be helping more than 15
scientific experts from 7 universities across 3 different countries,
who all contributed to putting this questionnaire together. In the
future, the data you provide will be available to countless
researchers across the world and will help in answering
important questions on human development, health and disease.

Please remember that your answers to all these questions are
confidential  and  will  be  processed  using  a  unique  ID  number.
All your personal details will be removed and no researcher will be
able to link your answers back to you.

Some  questions  may  seem  very  similar  to  each  other;  this  is
because  the  combination  of  answers  gives  a clearer picture than
one  single  answer.  

There  may  be  questions  that  seem  a  bit  strange  and  are  not
applicable  to  you  because  they  are  concerned  with  specific
feelings  or  problems.   We  would  be  very  grateful if  you  would
try  to  answer  all  the  questions  but  we  understand  if  there  are
questions  that  you  either  prefer  not  to  answer  or  are  unable  to
answer.
 

If you do not wish to complete the questionnaire please tick the below
box and return to Children of the 90s in the envelope provided, as this
will stop any reminders.
