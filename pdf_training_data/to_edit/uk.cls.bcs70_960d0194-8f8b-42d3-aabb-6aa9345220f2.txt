INTRODUCTORY NOTES

First. may we take this opportunity to thank you for Carrying out these interviews on behalf of the Child Health and Education Study.

This stage of the research is funded mainly by grants from the Department of Health and Social Security and the Department of Education and Science. We
are grateful to Health and Education Authorities throughout England, Wales and Scotiand without whose co-operation this study could not have been carned
out.

The overail purpose of the research is to find out more about handicapped and disadvantaged children and the ways in which their lives, and the lives of their
families, may differ compared with those of other children. Our interest continues to focus on the vital relationship between the home and school
environments and how these affect the child's development and progress at the end of the primary stage of education. The questions are relevant to current
issues conceming the health and welfare of alt children and thetr families.

The Interview

itis hoped that normally the form will be completed in an interview with the child's mother. If for any reason the mother is unavailable, please interview the
person who can best answer questions about the child's health and development. Sometimes the child will not be living with his/her own {i.e. natural}
mother. In this case the term ‘mother’ throughout the form should be taken to imply ‘present mother figure’ and, similarly. ‘father’ should be taken to imply
‘present father figure’.

In interviewing the mother, please assure her at the outset that her answers will be treated in the strictest confidence, and that the 16,000 children
concemed will not be identified by name. Please ask the questions in the way you consider to be the most appropriate to obtain the information required. If, in
the light of the mother's response during the interview, you feel that a particular question might be best omitted please feel free to do this, although ideally we
should like to have aif interviews fully completed.

PLEASE USE BLOCK CAPITALS

PLEASE ENSURE THAT EVERY QUESTION IS ANSWERED

Each question requires only one answer, unless indicated otherwise. Most questions can be answered by ticking the box
beside the relevant response. Other questions require a number for the answer.

EXAMPLE:

How long has study child lived at his/her present address?
Under six months............... CJ

Six months to a year............ C]

More than a year............... Ae How many years? | .

This means that the child has lived at the present address for 3 years.

For all answers requiring text it would be most helpful if you would use BLOCK CAPITALS.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
