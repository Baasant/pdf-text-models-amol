 FILLING IN THIS BOOKLET

Most of the questions can be answered by ticking the box beside the right answer.

For example

How many times have you been to the supermarket in the past week?

 None 1 12� 2-63 7 or more 4

 This means you went to the supermarket once in the past week

Sometimes there are questions with if in front of them.

For example

a) Have you been to the supermarket today?

Yes 1 No�  2

This means you didn't go to the supermarket and you don't
 need to answer the next question

b) If yes, did you buy any carrots?

Yes 1 No  2

In general, though, each question needs an answer.

In some questions you may be asked to describe something.
It would be helpful if you wrote as clearly as possible.

The small numbers in the squares are for office use only.
