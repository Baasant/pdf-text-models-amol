 Section B: About you

We want to examine the relationship between the levels of certain hormones in young women

and heart disease risk in the future. These hormone levels are linked to how regular your

periods are and how much body hair you have.

B1. Are you currently using:

   Yes      No

a) the oral contraceptive pill

b) the contraceptive injection (e.g. Depo-provera)?

c) a contraceptive implant under your skin (e.g. Implanon)?

d) a contraceptive coil with hormone (e.g. Mirena)?

e) a contraceptive patch?

The next question is going to ask you about how regular and long your menstrual cycles are.

What we mean when we ask about  length is the number of days between the first day of one

period and the first day of the next period. So, for example, if the first day that you started

bleeding on your last period was 7th May and the one before that was 10th April,  the length

of that cycle was 27 days.

B2. Are your periods regular?

Yes occur every 23 days or less

Yes occur between 24 and 35 days

Yes occur more than every 35 days

No

B3. What was the date of your last period?

(If you cannot remember the exact date please fill in as much detail as you can)
