Notes on completion of the questionnaire

The questionnaire is in two sections. Section A is
concerned with background information about the
school and can probably most easily be completed
by the headteacher. Section B consists of
questions about the study child. Most of these can
probably be answered by a form or class teacher,
but in some cases it may be necessary to consult a
subject teacher.

Questions are designed so that, as far as possible,
they can be completed with the minimum of difficulty
whilst allowing the processing and analyses of the
answers to be carried out conveniently. You will
find that they fall into three categories :

Firstly, there are those that fequire a written answer
and space is provided to write a few words,

Secondly, there are questions where you are offered
a number of alternative answers. each with a number
by it. In this case please ring the number

corresponding to your answer, You will also often
find that there is a space provided to be used when
your answer does not fall into any of the categories
offered. For example,

's this school :
A secondary school @
A primary school 2
Other (please specify) 3

For the third kind of question the answer is a number.
For these the number should be written in the box

or boxes provided. For example,

How ald is the study child ? [Ts] years
If you feel that any answer needs some qualification
or amplification, please add comments al that point
in the questionnaire
