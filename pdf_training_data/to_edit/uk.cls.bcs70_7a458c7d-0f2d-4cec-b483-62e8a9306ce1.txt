Introduction 

The British Cohort Study 2012 follow-up was carried out using computer assisted personal 
interviewing (CAPI). The survey instrument is a computer program written in a software 
package called Dimensions. This document is a paper representation of this computer 
program. 

Structure of the questionnaire 

The 2012 Follow-Up was comprised of two parts: a ‘core’ face-to-face interview and a paper 
self-completion questionnaire.  This document covers the ‘core’ face-to-face interview.  The 
paper self-completion questionnaire is provided in a separate document. 
 
The core interview began with the grids section which included 3 sub-sections: the 
‘Relationship History’ in which respondents provided details of all co-habiting relationships in 
the appropriate reference period; the ‘Child grid’ which collected details about all children 
that cohort members considered themselves a parent of (whether living in the cohort 
member’s household or otherwise) and the ‘Other household member grid’ which collected 
details about all other individuals living within the cohort member’s household.  The CAPI 
interview then covered grandchildren, parents, social support, housing, economic activity, 
pay, pensions, partner's economic activity, benefits and other income, inheritances, savings 
and debts, vocabulary assessment, education and qualifications, university attended and 
degree obtained, schooling at 16, family income, economic activity, education and 
qualifications, health, smoking, drinking, exercise, height and weight. 
 
The core interview concluded with a self-completion module (CASI) which collected 
information on social class identity, sexuality, dead children, gynaecological problems and 
menopause, fertility intentions, use of infertility treatments, unsuccessful pregnancies, 
relationship satisfaction, domestic division of labour, mental health problems, job 
satisfaction, work-life balance and life satisfaction. 
 
In addition to the ‘Relationship History’ the CAPI interview included two further event history 
modules covering housing and economic activity.  These sections asked cohort members to 
update their situation in these areas in chronological order from a point set by the CAPI 
program. The date at which the cohort member is asked to update their situation from 
depends on when they were last interviewed.  
 
Cohort members interviewed since 1st October 1999 (i.e.1999/2000, 2004/5 or 2008 follow-
ups) were asked to update their situation from the date of their last interview.   
 
Cohort members who have not been interviewed since 1st October 1999 were asked to 
update their situation from a set start point, the 1st January 2000.  The three history modules 
were, for the first time completed with the aid of an electronic visual calendar.  More 
information about the calendar is provided in the BCS70 2012 Follow-Up Technical Report. 
 
In situations where cohort members could not understand the questions (even through an 
interpreter) or communicate the answers for themselves, the interviewer attempted to 
conduct a proxy interview with a carer or family member. The proxy interview was 
approximately 20 minutes long and can be found at the end of this document.

Features of the documentation 

Modules 

The CAPI questionnaire comprises modules that contain a list of all the questions, answer 
options, and the routing conditions or ‘rules’ which govern when a particular question should 
be asked. In general, the heading of each module summarises the topics covered and gives 
the module title. 

 Questions and answers 

Questions all have a unique name which is usually  derived from the content of the question. 
Question names are identified by their bold formatting. The text of the question that should 
be read out by the interviewer is displayed in sentence case, with the end of the question 
usually indicated by a question mark. 
 
At most questions, the respondent chooses his/her answer(s) from a pre-defined list which is 
either read out to him/her by the interviewer or which he/she reads from a show card sent to 
the respondent ahead of the interview.  At other times the respondent is not offered a pre-
defined choice of answer categories.  Instead the interviewer codes their spontaneous 
response into a pre-defined list of answers.  Alternatively the interviewer may be asked to 
record the verbatim answer.  
 
Questions at which a pre-defined list of answers are given can be split into two types: single-
coded and multi-coded. Single-coded questions allow only one answer category to be 
chosen – unless otherwise stated, the question is single-coded. Multi-coded questions are  
usually identified by a note to the interviewer to ‘CODE ALL THAT APPLY’ and allow more 
than one answers to be recoded. At some multi-coded questions, one of the answers may 
be an ‘exclusive code’. This means that if this answer is chosen, no other answers may be 
chosen at the same time. If this answer is chosen alongside other answers, CAPI activates a 
check.  
 
Unless otherwise stated all questions also allow ‘Don’t Know’ and ‘Refusal’ answers to be 
entered. Where these are not allowed, it is stated below the answers. 
 
We also use a long box at the beginning of some sections which contain a set of repeated 
questions about a particular event or about multiple members in the household. 

Routing instructions 

Routing instructions are fully detailed in italics at appropriate points. The routing condition is 
both explained in words and given in terms of the logical command. The expressions ‘<’ ,’=’, 
‘>’ are used to denote ‘less than’, ‘equal to’ and ‘more than’ respectively. The term ‘<>’ 
means ‘not equal to’. The routing condition is displayed immediately before the first question 
to which it applies and is indicated by an ‘IF’ statement. The end of the influence of a 
particular routing condition is indicated by an ‘END OF FILTER’ instruction.  
 
Additionally, if the routing uses 'feed forward' information from a prior interview, that variable 
will be referred to with the prefix 'FF' (for 'Feed Forward'). Thus ‘FFRECON’ refers to cohort 
members economic activity at the prior sweep.  A list of all 'Feed Forward' variables is 
provided at the end of the document.

Textfills 

In some cases the text of a question may be varied automatically to take account of the 
particular circumstances of the respondent using a ‘textfill’. These possible different 
wordings are defined along with the circumstances in which they are used. In other words, 
textfills are used to tailor the question wording to the respondent’s circumstances. Textfills 
are preceded by ‘[^’ and followed by ‘]’. When more than one possible textfill appears within 
a question, they are separated by ‘/’ .  
 
For example, reference to the name of the cohort member or other persons in the household 
will be documented as [^Cohort member's name] and [^Name of person] respectively.  
 
There are some other common textfills that are used repeatedly throughout the 
questionnaire:  
 

 [^he / she], [^his / her] refer to gender and should be read accordingly 
 [^Date of last interview] refers to the day, month and year of the previous interview e..g. 

‘15th of June 2004’. 

Checks 

An advantage of CATI questionnaires is that checks can be included in the program to alert 
interviewers when an unlikely or impossible response has been entered.  
 
'Hard' checks can be used to prevent logical inconsistency (for example so that the cohort 
member cannot be younger than his / her children). In such circumstances, a warning screen 
is activated to alert the interviewer to the problem and instruct the interviewer to change the 
answer recorded. The interviewer cannot bypass hard checks – they must identify the 
problem and resolve the discrepancy before proceeding. 
 
'Soft' checks are used to bring improbabilities to the attention of the interviewer. For 
example, if the weight of the cohort member is higher or lower than expected. In such 
situations the interviewer is instructed to investigate the improbable answer and make any 
necessary corrections. If the interviewer is confident that the information given is correct, 
they may suppress the warning and continue with the interview. 
 
Most modules contain checks so that interviewers can resolve/check them with the 
respondents during the course of interview. Checks are referenced at the question at which 
they occur (e.g. Check GR1) and specified in detail at the end in this documentation.  

Help screens 

Some modules contain a help screen, which is a text box providing additional information to 
facilitate defining and coding answers during the interview. Help screens are indicated and 
described at the question at which they occur. 

Income information and unfolding brackets 

A feature of the income questions is the use of a series of questions referred to as ‘unfolding 
brackets’ which are triggered if a respondent refuses or is unable to provide an exact 
answer.   The questions are designed to elicit a minimum and maximum value which define 
a range or “closed band” within which the actual value lies. 
   



 

6 
 

On entering the unfolding brackets, respondents are asked to say whether they have more, 
less or about the same as a particular value. This question is repeated using different values 
(which will be a lower or higher value depending on the answer to the preceding question).   
 
The procedure stops at the point when either an upper and lower bound is provided, the 
respondent refuses or says “don’t know”, or the respondent places themselves in the top or 
bottom bracket.  
    
The unfolding bracket questions are randomly ordered for each respondent such that any 
possible 'anchoring' effects (i.e. where people use the suggested figure as a reference point 
and make adjustments to it to reach their answer) from the procedure are averaged across 
the distribution, and the bracket values are selected on the basis of the density of the 
underlying financial variable.

|  |  CM's WORKING ON-CALL: If someone states at the hours questions that they usually 
|  |  work 24 hours a day because they are 'on call', the average number of hours actually 
|  |  worked should be probed for. Identify how many hours were actually worked in the last 
|  |  four weeks and average these out to give a weekly total for usual hours. This should 
|  |  include only those hours during which the CM was actually working. Therefore if, for 
|  |  example, a CM was 'on-call' all night, but was only called out to work for two hours, 
|  |  the actual working hours for this night would be two hours.
