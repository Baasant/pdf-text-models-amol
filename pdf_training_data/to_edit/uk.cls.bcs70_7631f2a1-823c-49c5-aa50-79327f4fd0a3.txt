2.2. This section asks whether you yourself have ever done a number of activities. Some of these are considered to be against the
law, we have also included'a number of questions on harmless activities which are not punishable by law.
The questions are scrambled. So unless the key is known, no one will ever know what your answers are. Only we know the key

and your name will never be associated with your answers.

The scrambling works like this. The things about which we want to find out are on LIST A and LIST B. Each list contains the
same questions but in a different order. You answer either LIST A or LIST B, but no one but you and us knows which list you
have answered. The list you should use to fill in the answers to question 2.2 is shown in a box in the lower half of page 7 of
this questionnaire. Turn to this. and memorise whether you are to use fist A or B. If necessary, write it down on a separate piece
of paper which you can destroy later. Then erase the letter A or B in the box by writing over it inink. Then answer question 2 2.
Nobody but yourself and us will know which list you have used. Remember also that you are able to seal up the questionnaire in

a special envelope. so that nobody will see your answers.

the List B variables have been renamed to match the List A variables. The columns a - 0 therefore
represent the substances in List A but for the total sample. The Sporting activities have been removed
