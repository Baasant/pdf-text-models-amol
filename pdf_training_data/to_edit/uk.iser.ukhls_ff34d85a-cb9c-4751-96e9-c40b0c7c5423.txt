Q24

Please tick the box that indicates how strongly you agree or disagree with each statement.

Strongly  
agree Agree

Neither agree 
nor disagree Disagree

I feel like I belong to this neighbourhood.

The friendships and associations I have with other

If I needed advice about something I could go to 
someone in my neighbourhood.

I borrow things and exchange favours with  
my neighbours.

I would be willing to work together with others  
on something to improve my neighbourhood.

I plan to remain a resident of this neighbourhood  
for a number of years.

I like to think of myself as similar to the people  
who live in this neighbourhood.

I regularly stop and talk with people in  
my neighbourhood.

It’s not worth me doing things to help the environment if others don’t do 
the same

It’s not worth Britain trying to combat climate change, because other 
countries will just cancel out what we do

People in the UK will be affected by climate change in the next 30 years

People in the UK will be affected by climate change in the next 200 years

Any changes I make to help the environment need to fit in with  
my lifestyle

Yes, believe 
this

No, do not 
believe this
