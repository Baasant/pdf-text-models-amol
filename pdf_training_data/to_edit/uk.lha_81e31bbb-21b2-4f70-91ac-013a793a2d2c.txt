CONTROL STUDY

This young person is a member of a control group for this Survey: this group is used to check that
the main Survey Sample is still representative of the age-group. In order to confirm that the
pattern of employment, training and further education among our sample is typical, we should like
to obtain some information for the control group, up to 9th March 1964.

Please complete the form as fully as you can — the manner of obtaining the information is
left entirely to the discretion of YEOs.

The anonymity of the information concerning this group will be guaranteed by the CYEE
Regional Representative, who will tear off the top half of this form, which contains the information
identifying this young person, before returning it to us. YEOs are asked to leave the forms intact,
as otherwise there will be no way of knowing which forms have been returned to the Regional
Representatives.
