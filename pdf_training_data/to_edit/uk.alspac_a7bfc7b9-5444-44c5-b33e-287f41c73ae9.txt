This questionnaire is for the parent who is most involved in the day-to-day care of your
toddler. Usually this will be the mother. Its purpose is to find out what problems toddlers
and their parents have.Your answers will help us to identify those problems that may be
solved by changes in the health care system.

To answer simply tick the box which is most accurate in your opinion.

Some questions are the same as those you answered a year ago.This is so that we can tell
what changes have happened to you.

Please answer all questions if you can, even if they are similar.If you cannot answer a
question or if it does not apply to you, put a line through it.There are no good or bad
answers.Just tell us what you really think.

All answers are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
