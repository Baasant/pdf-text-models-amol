Please answer as much as you can. 
Just tick the box which is most accurate in your opinion. 

 
There are no good or bad answers, just tell us what is true for you. 

If there is a question you don’t want to answer or it 
doesn’t apply to you – put a line through it. 

 
 

  

 

 
 
 
We know there are some questions you have answered before but we need to 

ask them regularly so we can track the changes that 
have happened to you and your family. In time we will be able to tell whether 

the changes have had an effect on your health and that of your family. 
 

We understand that this may be boring for you, but hope you will be patient. 
 

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
