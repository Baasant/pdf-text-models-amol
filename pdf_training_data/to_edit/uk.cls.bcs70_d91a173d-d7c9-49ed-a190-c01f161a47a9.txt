Health Records etc. School medical record cards(s); any available screening records, assessment
results, hospital reports, etc.; health file on any children with handicap or
disability.

NOTE: IF ONE OR MORE OF THE ABOVE ITEMS IS NOT AVILABLE PLEASE COMPLETE THE MEDICAL
EXAMINATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.

Introduction
Most, Dut not all, of the cohort and their parents have already participated in this Study, either in the Perinatal period

intermediately, or at five or ten years.

At five and ten years, health visitors of your DHA caried out an extensive review of the health, development and pre.
school care.

At ten years we were able, through your DHA, to identify members of the cohort who had health problems, disabilities
and handicaps. Health Visitors and Community Medical Officers kindly conducted interviews and examinations.

Parents of the teenagers have this time received a letter explaining the 16 year Study, inviting their co-operation and
ensuring therm of confidentiality.

This time some of the mothers will already have been interviewed at home by a health visitor/school nurse; for the
remainder, the home interview could be done subsequently, or accomplished at the same time as the medical
examination provided that the mother aqrees to attend at that time. The documents needed for the maternat inte:view
consist of The Parental Interview Form (Document O), The Maternal Self-Completion Form (Document P) and The
Teenage Leisure Diary (Document S). For the medical examination the following documents are needed (i) The Medical
Examination Form (Document R), (ii) The Teenage Health Self-Completion Questionnaire, which should be completed
by the teenager at the time of attendance for the medical examination (iii) The Information Manual for Headlitt Personnel
(Document N)}, includes the necessary instructions and contains a Sheridan-Gardiner Near Vision sheet for testing near
vision.

Your Local Education Authority has kindly traced the whereabouts of the cohort tn your OHA and has arranged a
separate school educational assessment of each teenager, including lests of reading, vocabulary. mathematics,
matrices and spelling; from this, it will be possible to identify slow learners and teenagers with educational as well as
health problems.

THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION FORM IS IN THREE SECTIONS

Section 1. (A) Use of Service, (B) Disabilities (pages 3 and 4)

in order to complete this section fully, you will need to assemble all the teenager's school medical records and all other
relevant school health and educational documents. You are asked to pay particular attention to assembling complete
records of any teenager who is handicapped, receiving special education, or who has been assessed for special
educational needs. You will be asked to provide a summary from the notes of the progress and current status of each
such teenager. Even if only partial records are accessible to you, please complete all Sections of this questionnaire as
far as possible at the time of the medical examination.

Section 2. (A) Morbidity and Special Senses, (B} Medical Examination (pages 4-9}

Please make sure that the recommended equipment is available. Please read in advance if you have time, the medical
history from the Parental interview Form if already completed. Please read through the medical questions carefully
before the examination. If you have time, please try out the co-ordination tests. The medical examination is structured
to provide the maximum information while leaving you free to conduct the clinical examnation in any way you find
optimal. Tests such as distant and near vision and measurements of height, weight, head circumference and blood
pressure have been aggregated in the medical examination form, in case it proves expedient to carry these out just prior
to the actual clinical examination. Please feel free to undertake the necessary measurements, in the order which best
suits the facilities available to you and anyone helping you with the examination.

Section 3: Medical Summary. This is self-explanatory (pages 10 and 11}

Section 4: The Audiogram (page 12)

An Audiogram form is on the last sheet of the examination form. It is presumed that this will be done by sweep
audiometry. The form also contains space in case pure-tone audiometry is used. You are asked to record whether the
results of sweep audiometry are normal or abnormal! and if sweep results are abnormal, to arrange to let us have details
of pure-tone audiometry. In instance where sweep audiometry is impossible to arrange, or is delayed unavoidably,the
remainder of completed health documents should be sent on to us in advance of the audiogram.

SECTION 2B. MEDICAL EXAMINATION

INITIAL PULSE RATE
Before starting the Medical Examination, please settle the teenager for 2 minutes and take the pulse (over 1

Pulse rate RD!) beats in 1 minute
Recommended technique:

Please position the teenager upright against a flat wall or a door. Encourage him/her to stretch to full height.
keeping heels on the fioor. Heels and buttocks should be flush against wall or door. Place a hardboard/book on the
teenager's head. Mark the position of the lower edge with a pencil and then measure the height from the ground
with a wood or steel measuring rod or steel tape measure. Alternatively, use measuring device on the back of a
weighing machine and observe precautions as above. NB. Remove shoes before height is measured.

D5. BLOOD PRESSURE

Please postpone to fater in examination tf you feel teenager is nervous.

Sphygmomanometer cuff must have bladder long enough to encircle the arm completely and be wide
enough to cover two-thirds of the length of the upper arm. The cuff should preferably be at least 5 inches deep.

(vis realised that you will be experienced in taking blood pressures, but we ask you to follow the instructions

closely for uniformity: —

Sit subject on chair in as relaxed a state as possible. Wrap the cuff around the right upper arm, placing the rubber tubes
from the bladder posteriorly for ease of access to right Antecubital fossa. Paipate the right radial pulse and inflate the cuff
to about 30mm.Hg. above the disappearance of the pulse. Slowly deflate till the pulse reappears. Deflate the cuff.

Place the stethoscope in the antecubital fossa over the brachial artery,

but not in contact with any part of the cuff. Rapidly

inflate the cuff to about 30mm.Hg. above the systolic pressure and then deflate at a rate of 2-3mm.Hg. per second.
The appearance of faint clear tapping sounds for 2 consecutive beats should be recorded as the Systolic Pressure.

Continue to deflate the cuff and the sounds will soften or may become swishing, then sharper sounds will reappear. With
continuing deflation, there will be a sudden muffling of sounds. which will become soft and blowing. This is Korotkoff’s

4th sound and represents the Diastolic Pressure. Do not wait until the point of complete disappearance of sounds.

E. MOTOR COORDINATION TESTS

The following four tests will identify a clumsy or inco-ordinate subject as far as this is possible on clinical examination,
Such tests are non-specific and difficult to validate. but will be used in conjunction with other findings and the Opinions
of teachers and parents, recorded elsewhere. The results will inevitably be influenced by the effects of subject's skill
and experience. At the end of the tests the examiner is asked to give a considered opinion as to the degree of
clumsiness or inco-ordination.

Please test all Youthscan teenagers except those who are grossly handicapped or those who are incapable of under-
standing the test(s). In these instances, please enter the reason after question E4.

E1. THROWING A BALLIN THE AIR

You will need a tennis ball. or a rubber bail of equivalent size and weight.

The important point about this test is to discover the subject’s optimum performance. We would therefore he
grateful if you would carry out the testin the following way:

Ask the subject to stand in a space so that he/she has room to mave. Say ‘Il want you to show me if you can throw
the ball up in the air and catch it’. Allow two or three initial attempts. If the subject fails to catch the ball, record
the fact and do not proceed with the test.

If the subject can catch the ball, say ‘Now throw the ball up in the air and clap your hands together once before
you catch it.” Then repeat the procedure increasing the number of claps until the subject fails on two successive
attempts. Record the greatest number of claps resulting in a successful catch.

If the greatest number of claps was 2 or more, ask him/her to repeat the test. catching with one hand only. Let
him/her use preferred hand

E2. FIGURE DRAWING ON PALM OF HAND: (GRAPHESTHESIA}

 

You will need a blunt point, for example a biro with tip retracted. O x oO 3

 

 

 

Ask the subject to place both his/her hands ona table, palms uppermost. Using the blunt point, firmly describe a
figure 8 on the subject’s right palm. Take two seconds to draw it, and allow the subject to watch. Ask him/her

Please make sure subject has no shoes on. a om
Find a straight line on the floor at least 4 metres tong, e.g. the groove of 2 floorboard, or mark one out with chalk
Use a corridor if the examination room is not long enough.

Ask the subject to put his/her hands on hips and then to walk backwards along the line, placing one foot behind
the other, toe-to-heel.

First demonstrate the test, saying ‘I want you to walk like this. Remember your toes must touch your heel with
each step you take. Keep your hands on your hips. Walk backwards in a straight line. You may glance behind you
if it helps’.

Let the subject have two practices by asking him/her to walk backwards for 5 steps on each occasion.

Then ask the subject to walk backwards for 20 steps. Count the number of steps made before any error occurs.
An error occurs if the subject ceases to maintain toe-to heel or deviates from the line or moves either hand from
hips. If an error is made in the first 5 steps, continue to count the number of steps until the next error.
