YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

These questions are about you and your friends. As you know,
friendships are very important - for happiness, for health and
for getting on in the world. But researchers really don't know
much about how friendships are formed. That's where you
come in!! These questions are designed to help us understand
who makes friends with who, and what friends do together.

As usual with Children of the 90s questions, all of your
answers are completely private and no-one else will know who
you've named as friends. We know that this is important to
you, so it's worth repeating: no young person or parent from
the Children of the 90s and no-one working with the data will
ever see the names you put down.

There are some questions about each best friend that you nominate. You can
nominate 5 friends, or less, if you want to. Don't include brothers and sisters
in here, but you can include boyfriends or girlfriends. You don't need to worry
about the order you write them down in. The researchers will take the people
as just five best friends - they won't assume that the one you write down first
is your best best friend. When you are finished filling in the details on your
friends, please go to Page 24 for a few final questions.
