EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR THE MEMBER OF STAFF COMPLETING THIS FORM

This pupil/student was enrolled at birth in a National Survey of Health and Development. With
the help of his parents and of health visitors, school teachers and nurses, a detailed account has
been obtained of his health and development during the past 17 years. The Survey boys and girls
come from all types of home, and are attending, or have attended all types of school and college, both
local authority and independent: a great number are of course already in employment. Only 2% of those
at school in England, Wales and Scotland have been lost, and the value of this enquiry depends onour
continuing to obtain information for every possible Survey member: the fewer the losses the more
valuable is the information received. We are particularly interested in the group that was still at
school last autumn, and hope that you will be able to give us information about the above-named
pupil’s/student’s examination record, absences, and leaving date if relevant.
