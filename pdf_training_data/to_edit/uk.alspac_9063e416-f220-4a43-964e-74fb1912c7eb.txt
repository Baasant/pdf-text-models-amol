This questionnaire asks about your child since he was 18 months old. We
are interested to know about his health and behaviour and how he gets
on with other children. Your answers will help us to understand the
developing child and to identify problems that children and their
parents have.

This questionnaire is like the other questionnaires you have received. To
answer simply tick the box which best describes your child or your
child's situation. Again some questions will seem similar but they are
not the same. Please answer all questions that you can. If you cannot
answer any question or if they do not apply to you please put a line
through them. There are no right or wrong answers. Please just
describe what happens in your situation. You may make additional
comments at the end. All answers are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
