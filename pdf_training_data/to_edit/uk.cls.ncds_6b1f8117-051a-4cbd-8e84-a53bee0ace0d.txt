National Child
Development Study - Stage 5

 

Your Life Since 1974

To give us an idea of some of the things you have been doing in recent
years, and to help the interviewer complete the main interview with you,
we would like you to fill in this questionnaire. Instructions on how to fill it
in are given on the next page.




What we want you to do

 

We would like to know about some of the things that have happened to
you in recent years.

It is not always easy to remember details of events that may have
happened some time ago, so we are concentrating on just a few things -.
like leaving school, getting married, the birth of children, changing jobs,
changing address and so on. We want you to answer just a few simple
questions about each of these topics.

You will see that we are particularly concerned about when things
happen. We have provided a Calendar over the page covering the period
we are interested in. We hope that this may help you remember when
things happened and in what order, and so make it easier to complete this
questionnaire. Your birthday is already marked each year - please mark
other dates which are important to.you on the calendar if you think it will
help you sort things out.

If you can’t remember exact dates, please just make the best guess you
can, so for instance, if you know you moved house between January and
March but can’t remember precisely when, then just record it as February.

 

Your completed questionnaire
will be collected by our interviewer.

 

Please keep it safe!

 

 

We’ve tried to make this form easy for you to fill in.
If you need help please ask the interviewer
when he/she calls.
