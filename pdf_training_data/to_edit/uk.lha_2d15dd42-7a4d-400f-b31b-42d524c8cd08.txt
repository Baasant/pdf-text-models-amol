IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF THE
NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER THE LAST
ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. IN EITHER CASE RETURN THE FORM
TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.

Purpose of this enquiry.

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of
Medical Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. The children in this survey are representative of all births in England, Wales
and Scotland in March, 1946.. They are drawn from all social classes and during the first ten years of their lives only 8 per cent. of the children in
the original sample have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information being obtained for every possible survey child. The Joint
Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

How to fill in this form.

Five thousand children scattered all over the country are being given this examination, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of
doctors who are examining them should record their findings ina comparable way. For this reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this
examination form has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several printed alternatives. All that is required
is to put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write the answer
in the space directly under the question. Similarly, if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your findings, we
should be most grateful for any further information you can give us. When a question does not apply it should be struck through. When either the Doctor
or the Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact should be recorded in the space directly under the question.

In order to ensure that these many medical histories are obtained in the same way it is important, when questioning the parent, that the werdiag —

and order of this form should be adhered to.

COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO THE JOINT
COMMITTEE

 

It is hoped that the A. MEDICAL HISTORY

Mother &/or Father
will be present at
this examination

Put a circle round the code number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your
findings. If no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question.

 

 

If a question does not apply, strike it through.

meatus are in the same horizontal plane. The child should be
told to make himself as tall as possible without lifting his heels
from the ground. A deep bveath should be taken as this helps
to bring him up to his maximum height.”
