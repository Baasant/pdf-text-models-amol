During the past year you have very kindly kept a record of this child’s absences from school which has provided
valuable information on his health. Could you return this 1952/3 School Absence Record Card to the Director of
Education at the end of the summer term and at the same time complete and return the questions asked below relating
to the child’s school history. A new Absence Record Card for 1953/4 will be sent out in September. May I take
