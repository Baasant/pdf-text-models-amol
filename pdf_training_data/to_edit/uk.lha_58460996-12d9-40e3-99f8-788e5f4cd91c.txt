If a child has moved to another school this form should be returned
to the Director of Education and not sent directly to the new school.

You will know that your mother has answered questions about your health and that you have done
special tests at school. The reason why we are interested in your health and school progress is that we are
keeping in touch with girls and boys all over Great Britain who were born in the first week of Marc 1946.

This time we should like to ask you yourself some questions about the things you like to do.

Please answer every question. When the answer is “ Yes” or “No” all that is necessary is for you
to put a ring round the answer which is correct. ~

When you have answered all the questions please give this form back to your teacher.

CPi

(c) SUPPOSING you could be anybody, go anywhere, or do anything, would you still want to do the
