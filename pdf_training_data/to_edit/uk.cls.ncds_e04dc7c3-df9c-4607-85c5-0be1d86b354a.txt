NCDS BIOMEDICAL SURVEY: CAPI QUESTIONNAIRE

Foreword

The interview was carried out by the research nurse as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI).  The
survey instrument was written as a computer program using BLAISE software.  This is the documentation of
the program.  It shows the wording of questions, instructions to the nurse, routing (i.e. the rules which
dictated the questions asked) and – at the end of the document – checks built into the program to ensure
that data was entered correctly.  The last include ‘soft’ checks, to remind nurses of procedures or signal
improbable values, and ‘hard’ checks, which excluded values outside a pre-determined range or
unacceptable combinations of response codes.

This is a record of the interview, rather than a guide to the archived data set.  Variables derived as part of
the CAPI program are included where these are essential parts of the output (e.g. summary variables based
on several measurements) or are necessary to the routing of the questionnaire.  Other variables in the data
set, including variables produced as part of the editing process, are not shown.

|  I am going to test your hearing by measuring the faintest sounds you can hear. I will play you two different
|  tones in each ear, and with each tone, I will play it at different levels of loudness and softness.
|  As soon as you hear a sound, raise your finger. Keep it raised as long as you can hear the sound,
|  no matter which ear you hear it in. Put your finger down when you cannot hear the sound.
|  It is important that you keep as quiet as possible, in order to hear the quietest tones. Even if the sound is
|  very faint, and no matter which ear it is in, raise your finger. It will help if you breathe quietly through your
|  mouth. No matter how faint the sound you hear, raise your finger when you think you can hear it
|  and lower your finger when you can't hear the sound any longer. 
|  CHECK THAT RESPONDENT IS NOT WEARING HEARING AID, SPECTACLES, EARRINGS.

CONSENT TO BLOOD SAMPLING If you agree I would now like to take a sample of your blood.
As explained in the information sheet, this is an important part of the study, because the blood can be
analysed in a number of ways. Some tests will be performed in the lab as soon as they receive the sample.
Other tests may be done in future on portions of blood which have been stored frozen for many years. 
There is currently interest in genetic tests which use the DNA contained in white blood cells, and you were
sent a separate leaflet explaining this. Do you have any questions about the blood collection or
the storage of blood or DNA for medical research purposes?
1 Question/s asked
2 No question/s asked

BLCONS2
We need your written permission to collect a blood sample, to store portions of it for future research, to use
the DNA, and to store the white blood cells so that in future they can be used as a renewable source of
DNA. You can choose whether to give your signed consent for each of these four things.

which is a measure of stress. Because cortisol levels vary during the day, we need to take samples at
specific times. Would you be willing to take samples of your saliva during the next couple of days. It won't
take very much time. We will give you an envelope to post the samples to us.
