In what M. and C.W. Authority is it ?

HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY YOUR MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TO RECEIVE IT.
Approach to the Mother.

Remind her that she was visited soon after her baby was born in March, 1946. We now want to find out what progress

her baby has made. By giving as many details as she can, she will be helping us to plan better health services. All information
she gives will, of course, be treated as ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL.

How to fill in this Form.

This inquiry refers throughout to THE BABY BORN IN MARCH, 1946.

 

  

  

 

3h
2. Before you interview the mother read through the questionnaire and answer as many questions as possible from your
records and those of the Infant Welfare Centre. Check with the mother, when you interview her, all the answers you
have obtained from the records.
3. The questions are printed in heavy type and the mother’s answers in light type. Instructions to the interviewer are in
italics. i
4. The answers to the questions are shown by putting a ring with a soft pencil round the code number or letter opposite the j
mother’s answer. If the answer does not fit any alternative write it below the question itself. If a mother refuses or is
unable to answer any question put a ring round “ X”’ or “‘ XX”’ for ‘‘ No answer.”
5. Please follow the order of the questions as set out in the questionnaire and keep as close to the phrasing as you can. When
any question does not apply to a particular mother or baby ring the code number “ Y”’ or “‘ YY ’’ for “‘ does not apply.”
Do not strike through a question or leave it blank. EVERY QUESTION SHOULD BE ANSWERED. Before leaving
the mother please check through the questionnaire to see that this has been done.
6. Some of the questions on illness are in tabular form. Deal with each illness in turn and record the answer to each question
by putting a ring round the appropriate code number in the column referring to the illness with which you are dealing.
7. The comments on home conditions at the end of this questionnaire should be filled in from your own knowledge and
observation of the household. Do NOT ask the mother these questions.
8. If a baby has died please try to obtain all the details you can about his health and development up to the date of death.
It is just as essential to obtain information about a baby who has died as about one who is alive. However, use your
judgment in leaving out any question that might cause embarrassment.
9. Ifthe mother refuses to be interviewed try to find out her reasons and write them in the space provided. Then fill in as much
of the questionnaire as you can from the records, and RETURN THE FORM WITH THE OTHERS YOU HAVE COM-
PLETED.
10. When you have completed your interviews, hand the questionnaires to whoever has been delegated by your Medical Officer
of Health to receive them.
