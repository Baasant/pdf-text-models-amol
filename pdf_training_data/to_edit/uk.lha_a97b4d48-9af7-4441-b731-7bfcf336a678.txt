INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING THIS INTERVIEW SCHEDULE

Please read through this schedule before using it, to make yourself familiar with the questions,
layout, etc.

Instructions for the interviewing Y.E.O. are written in italics. The actual questions to be read
out are in bold type. Please adhere to the wording and order of the questions given. Many questions are
pre-coded In these questions you are asked to circle the number against the appropriate answer. You may
have to question a youngster a little further to enable you to classify his answer more easily. But do not
read out the pre-coded answers as suggestions, except where the instruction “show” is given. This is
most important, as otherwise uncontrollable bias may be introduced.

Questions 95-106 are for you to answer yourself, Please do not answer them in the youngster’s
presence.

Please start the interview with the following introduction, together with any other comment you
feel appropriate to the particular youngster:

“As you know, you are one of a group of 5000 young people all over the country who have been
followed up since they were born in March 1946 by this National Survey. | expect you remember that
when you were at school you occasionally had a form to fill in, or you had to have a special examination
by the doctor. Well, now that you have left school the survey people would like to know how you're getting
on, and they’ve asked me to ask you some questions about what you’ve been doing since last year. It
isn’t a test, it’s just to give us an idea of what’s happened to you since you left school.

Everything you tell me will be treated as confidential information, none of it will go into the
records here, or to your employer, or to anyone else except the survey people. And remember, there are no
right or wrong answers to these questions, | just want you to give me the answers thatare true for you.”

 

ADMINSTRATION OF PERSONAL QUESTIONNAIRE Y Ib

When you have completed question 94 of the schedule, introduce the Personal Questionnaire Y lb
with the following comment:-
: “Now I’d like you to answer some questions for yourself. Some of them you might think are a
bit more private than those I’ve just asked you, so when you've finished put the form in this envelope
and stick it down. If you don’t understand what a question means I'll try and help. Where a question has
got several possible answers, like this, [show example] what you have to do is to put a circle round the
number against the answer that is right for you. Try and answer all the questions.”

Please try and arrange for the youngster to fill in the form in a quiet place. Make sure he has
something to write with, and give him an ordinary 9” x 4” envelope on which you have written, plainly,
“Strictly Confidential”, “National Survey”, and his name andreference number as on the top of this booklet.

Watch the youngster for a little to see if he needs help, and give it if he asks for it. But please
do not suggest answers. If any part of the questionnaire is clearly beyond him, then leave it, When he
has completed the questionnaire and sealed it, please thank him profusely for “helping once again with
this Survey”.

Instructions for the despatch of the forms will be found on the separate sheet “Notes for Youth
Employment Officers”.

TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION

[If the youngster has taken any classes or courses since leaving school, please ask the following questions about each college session. Two columns are provided for each year to allow for

(1) complete changes of course during the year, e.g. Mechanical Engineering to Accountancy and (ii) in cases where the youngster has taken two different courses at the same time, e.g. day-
release in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical College, and two evenings a week at the Evening Institute doing ‘O’ Level French. If no such complications arise, use only the first column
for each year. Take one course at a time and ask all questions 68-86 for that course before tackling the next one.
