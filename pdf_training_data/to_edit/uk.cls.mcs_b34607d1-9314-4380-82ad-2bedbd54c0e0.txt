Class Groupings 

We are interested to know about groupings between and within classes in this child’s year. Q50-Q58 ask about
groupings between classes and Q59-Q67 ask about groupings within classes.

Some schools group children in the same year by general ability and they are taught in these groups for most or
all lessons. We refer to this as streaming.

Some schools group children from different classes by ability for certain subjects only and they may be taught in
different ability groups for different subjects. We refer to this as setting.

Other schools do not group children by ability between classes. Sometimes this may be because there are not
multiple classes in the year.

50 In this child’s year, is there streaming?

Some schools group children within the same class by general ability and they are taught in these ability groups
for most or all lessons. We refer to this as within-class ability grouping.

Some schools group children within the same class by ability for certain subjects only and they may be taught in
different ability groups for different subjects. We refer to this as within-class subject grouping.

Other schools do not group children by ability within classes. Some schools may use within-class groupings in
addition to between class streaming and setting and others may use within-class groupings instead of between
class streaming and setting.

Some schools may not use any general or subject specific ability groupings either within or between classes.
