The next question is going to ask you about how regular and long your menstrual cycles are.

What we mean when we ask about length is the number of days between the first day of one

period and the first day of the next period.

So, for example, if the first day that you started bleeding on your last period was 7th May

and the one before that was 10th April,  the length of that cycle was 27 days.

Yes occur between 24 and 35 days

Yes occur more than every 35 days

No

No longer have periods
