DIET DIARY

We would be grateful if you could keep this diary of everything you eat or drink over
the next five days. As you will see, each day is clearly marked, beginning with the first
thing in the morning and ending with food and drink at bedtime.

Please treat each day separately. Write in the name of all food or drink taken, a
description if necessary and the amount, for each part of the day. If nothing was eaten
or drunk during a part of the day, leave that section blank.

At the end of each day, there is a list of snacks and drinks that can easily be forgotten.
If not already mentioned in some other part of the day, please write in a description
and the amount in the space next to anything you may have forgotten. The nurse will
show you how to keep the diary and leave an example to help you. When the last day
has been filled in, post the booklet back to us in the envelope provided.

Overleaf is a list of popular foods and drinks. Next to each item, is the sort of thing
that we need to know so that we can tell what it is made of. We also show you the
kind of household measures that we would like you to think of when you tell us how
much you had. This list cannot cover all the foods and drinks that people may have, so
at the end are some notes on recording made up dishes and foreign foods.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
