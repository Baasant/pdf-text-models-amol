Youthscan will involve every maintained public and private secondary institution for secondary and special
education in the UK. It thus provides an opportunity to invite head teachers/masters/mistresses to give their own
judgement on a number of important issues concerning secondary education and the transition from adolescence to
adult life. We hope you wiil be willing to give your own analysis about some of these issues. You may care to give
your views on the following:

a) How to maintain a balance hetween tipholding academic standards and meating the needs of mannower,
industry and modern technology?

b) How to ease the transition from secondary-further‘higher education to the adult world of the 21st century?

c) How should schools approach preparation of pupils for the increase in disposable time consequent upon
mechanisation and the lack of opportunity for conventional employment?

d) More specifically, what if any are the special! circumstances relative to your own school‘neighbourhood? Could
you for instance, let us know the major strengths:weaknesses/needs for improvement ‘necessary innovations,
relevant to your own school situation.

Confidentiality will be respected fully. A self-sealing container is provided in case you wish your views to remain
entirely private. No school or person will be identified by name in any report. Please feel free to express-your views
in anyway you wish. If you would like to go on to use a separate sheet please staple it to this questionnaire.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMPLETING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE
