This questionnaire allows us to catch up with 
your current circumstances, health, diet and 
lifestyle.   

It is for the study child’s father or person 
who takes the role of father. This could be 
the mother’s husband or partner.   

If this is relevant to more than one person, it 
should be the one who is most involved with 
the study child. 

 We are very grateful to you for helping us in 
this way. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH
