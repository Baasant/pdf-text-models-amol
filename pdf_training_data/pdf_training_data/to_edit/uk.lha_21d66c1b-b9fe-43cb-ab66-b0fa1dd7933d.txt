IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF
THE NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER
THE LAST ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. IN EITHER CASE
RETURN THE FORM TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.

Approach to the Mother

Remind her that in previous years she gave us most valuable information about herself and her child. We now want to find out what progress
her child has made during the last year. All information she gives will, of course, be ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL.

Purpose of this inquiry

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of
Medical Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. The purpose of the present examination is to bring the medical and social
history up to date, to obtain further information about the school absences, and to check information previously noted.

The children in this sample are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in March 1946. They are drawn from all social
classes and during the first eight years of their lives only 8% of the original sample have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information
being obtained for every possible survey child. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

How to fill in this form.

Five thousand Mothers scattered all over the country are being interviewed, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of Health
Visitors and School Nurses who are seeing them should record their findings in a comparable way. For this reason, and also to reduce the amount of
clerical work, this form has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several printed alternatives. All that is
required is to put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write
the answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly, if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your
findings, we should be most grateful for any further information you can give us.

In order to ensure that this information is obtained in the same way by the many people taking part in the survey, it is important that the wording
and order of this form should be adhered to.

COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE Seer MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO THE JOINT
OMMITTEE.

THIS INQUIRY REFERS THROUGHOUT TO THE CHILD BORN IN MARCH 1946. RING THE CODE NUMBER OPPOSITE THE
MOTHER’S ANSWER. IF NO ANSWER IS GIVEN, OR IF A QUESTION DOES NOT APPLY, STRIKE IT THROUGH.

1. (a) Person interviewed.
