INTRODUCTION

Introduction 

The British Cohort Study 2008 sweep was carried out using computer assisted telephone 
interviewing (CATI). The survey instrument is a computer program written in a software 
package called Blaise. This document is a paper representation of this computer program. 

1.1 Structure of the questionnaire 

This paper representation covers the household grid and main respondent interview sections 
of the CATI questionnaire for BCS 2008.  The household grid was the first section of the 
CATI and would have been completed in all productive cases. Information about the 
household members was collected in this section. The respondent then received a CATI 
questionnaire that included questions about themselves, their children, and the household 
situation.  Interviews were conducted with cohort members only (there was no option for the 
interview to be completed by a proxy carer). 
 
The CATI interview includes four event history modules: Housing, Relationship history, 
Births and Employment. These modules ask cohort members to update their situation in 
these areas in chronological order from a point set by the CATI program. The date at which 
the cohort member is asked to update their situation from depends on when they were last 
interviewed.  
 
Cohort members interviewed since 1st October 1999 (i.e. in sweep 6 (1999/2000) and/or 
sweep 7 (2004/2005) of BCS70) are asked to update their situation from the date of their last 
interview.   
 
Cohort members who have not been interviewed since 1st October 1999 (and may never 
have been interviewed) are asked to update their situation from a set start point, the 1st 
January 2000, for all modules except the Births module. For the Births module, these cohort 
members are asked to update their situation from the date of their sixteenth birthday.  

1.2 Features of the documentation 

1.2.1 Modules 

The CATI questionnaire comprises modules that contain a list of all the questions, answer 
options, and the routing conditions or „rules‟ which govern when a particular question should 
be asked. In general, the heading of each module summarises the topics covered and gives 
the module title. 

1.2.2  Questions and answers 

In CATI, rather than being numbered, questions are given a unique name which is usually  
derived from the content of the question. Question names are identified by their bold 
formatting. The text of the question that should be read out by the interviewer is displayed in 
sentence case, with the end of the question usually indicated by a question mark. 
 
At most questions, the respondent chooses his/her answer(s) from a pre-defined list which is 
either read out to him/her by the interviewer or which he/she reads from a show card sent to 
the respondent ahead of the interview.  At other times the respondent is not offered a pre-



BRITISH COHORT STUDY 2008/9: QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTATION

defined choice of answer categories.  Instead the interviewer codes their spontaneous 
response into a pre-defined list of answers. 
 
Alternatively the interviewer may be asked to record the verbatim answer, which then 
appears in a „STRING‟ rather than „Number‟. At „STRING‟ answers, the number of 
characters allowed is limited (although interviewers can, where necessary, enter more 
characters in an electronic memo). For instance, in the documentation 'STRING60' indicates 
that a maximum of 60 characters is allowed. At „OPEN‟ questions, there is no limit on the 
number of characters. Interviewers may also be asked to enter answers in the form of a 
date, time or number.  
 
Questions at which a pre-defined list of answers are given can be split into two types: single-
coded and multi-coded. Single-coded questions allow only one answer category to be 
chosen – unless otherwise stated, the question is single-coded. Multi-coded questions are  
usually identified by a note to the interviewer to „CODE ALL THAT APPLY‟ and allow more 
than one answers to be recoded. At some multi-coded questions, one of the answers may 
be an „exclusive code‟. This means that if this answer is chosen, no other answers may be 
chosen at the same time. If this answer is chosen alongside other answers, CATI activates a 
check.  
 
Unless otherwise stated all questions also allow „Don‟t Know‟ and „Refusal‟ answers to be 
entered. Where these are not allowed, it is stated below the answers. 
 
We also use a long box at the beginning of some sections which contain a set of repeated 
questions about a particular event or about multiple members in the household. 

1.2.3  Routing instructions 

Routing instructions are fully detailed in italics at appropriate points. The routing condition is 
both explained in words and given in terms of the logical command. The expressions „<‟ ,‟=‟, 
„>‟ are used to denote „less than‟, „equal to‟ and „more than‟ respectively. The term „<>‟ 
means „not equal to‟. The routing condition is displayed immediately before the first question 
to which it applies and is indicated by an „IF‟ statement. The end of the influence of a 
particular routing condition is indicated by an „END OF FILTER‟ instruction.  
 
In the routing statements variables or questions will be referred to. If the question is from 
another module, then the question name will be prefixed by the module name. For instance, 
„QHGRID.RELTOKEY = 1' indicates that the question RELTOKEY is in the module 
'QHGRID' (the household grid module). 
 
Additionally, if the routing uses 'feed forward' information from a prior interview, that variable 
will be referred to with the prefix 'QFEEDF' (for 'Feed Forward'). Thus 
„QFEEDF.DECONACT‟ refers to the variable DECONACT (cohort member‟s economic 
activity) at a prior interview. 

1.2.4 Textfill 

In some cases the text of a question may be varied automatically to take account of the 
particular circumstances of the respondent using a „textfill‟. These possible different 
wordings are defined along with the circumstances in which they are used. In other words, 
textfills are used to tailor the question wording to the respondent‟s circumstances. Textfills 
are preceded by „[^‟ and followed by „]‟. When more than one possible textfill appears within 
a question, they are separated by „/‟ .  
 
For example, reference to the name of the cohort child or other persons in the household will 
be documented as [^Cohort child's name] and [^Name of person] respectively.  



INTRODUCTION 

3 

 
There are some other common textfills that are used repeatedly throughout the 
questionnaire:  
 

 [^he / she], [^his / her] refer to gender and should be read accordingly 
 [^Date of last interview] refers to the day, month and year of the previous interview e..g. 

„15th of June 2004‟. 

1.2.5  Checks 

An advantage of CATI questionnaires is that checks can be included in the program to alert 
interviewers when an unlikely or impossible response has been entered.  
 
'Hard' checks can be used to prevent logical inconsistency (for example so that the cohort 
member cannot be younger than his / her children). In such circumstances, a warning screen 
is activated to alert the interviewer to the problem and instruct the interviewer to change the 
answer recorded. The interviewer cannot bypass hard checks – they must identify the 
problem and resolve the discrepancy before proceeding. 
 
'Soft' checks are used to bring improbabilities to the attention of the interviewer. For 
example, if the weight of the cohort member is higher or lower than expected. In such 
situations the interviewer is instructed to investigate the improbable answer and make any 
necessary corrections. If the interviewer is confident that the information given is correct, 
they may suppress the warning and continue with the interview. 
 
Most modules contain checks so that interviewers can resolve/check them with the 
respondents during the course of interview. Checks are referenced at the question at which 
they occur (e.g. Check HH1) and specified in detail at the end in this documentation.  

1.2.6 Help screen 

Some modules contain a help screen, which is a text box providing additional information to 
facilitate defining and coding answers during the interview. The help screen is activated by 
the interviewer by pressing F9. Help screens are indicated and described at the question at 
which they occur. 

1.2.7 The Code Book 

At some questions in CATI, respondents are given the opportunity to choose an „other‟ 
answer and have this answer entered as STRING or OPEN text by the interviewer. Coding 
of these texts was conducted in the post-fieldwork data work, and this often involved creating 
additional codes for questions. Details of the coding can be found in the accompanying 
'Code book'. The questions affected are indicated in the documentation at the questions 
themselves, with the statement 'Please refer to the code book'. 

1.2.8 Income information and unfolding brackets 

A feature of the income questions (gross and net) in NCDS8 is the use of a series of 
questions referred to as „unfolding brackets‟ which are triggered if a respondent refuses or is 
unable to provide an exact answer.   The questions are designed to to elicit a minimum and 
maximum value which define a range or “closed band” within which the actual value lies.   
On entering the unfolding brackets, respondents are asked to say whether they have more, 
less or about the same as a particular value. This question is repeated using different values 
(which will be a lower or higher value depending on the answer to the preceding question).   
 



BRITISH COHORT STUDY 2008/9: QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTATION

The procedure stops at the point when either an upper and lower bound is provided, the 
respondent refuses or says “don‟t know”, or the respondent places themselves in the top or 
bottom bracket.  
    
The unfolding bracket questions are randomly ordered for each respondent such that any 
possible 'anchoring' effects (i.e. where people use the suggested figure as a reference point 
and make adjustments to it to reach their answer) from the procedure are averaged across 
the distribution, and the bracket values are selected on the basis of the density of the 
underlying financial variable.

7  The relationship grid is made up of one standard question set. The question at which the Cohort 
Member joins the grid depends on their legal and de facto marital status at the set start point (date 
of last interview/1

st
 January 2000). For example:  

 Cohort Members who were separated are first asked if they divorced their ex-partner (RDIVCEX) 

 Cohort Members who were cohabiting are first asked if they married that partner (RMARCP),  

 Cohort Members who were married are first asked if they are still living together with the same 
partner (RTOG) and, 

 Cohort Members who were single but have had since had at least one cohabiting relationship/legal 
union are first asked for details about their first relationship (PNME)  

 Please see technical report for structural diagram of relationship history grid. 
8
  There may be up to two „open‟ relationships – if a legal relationship has not yet been dissolved but a 
new cohabiting relationship has already started 

9
  An unfinished legal union refers to circumstances where the CM has separated from their spouse or 
civil partner but has not divorced or dissolved the partnership.

|  |  CM's WORKING ON-CALL: If someone states at the hours questions that they usually

|  |  four weeks and average these out to give a weekly total for usual hours. This should
