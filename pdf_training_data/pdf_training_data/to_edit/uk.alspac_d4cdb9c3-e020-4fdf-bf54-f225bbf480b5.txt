ABOUT THIS QUESTIONNAIRE

Thank you for filling in this questionnaire.

We realise it is quite long but a lot of interesting
things are happening to you!

ALL your answers are confidential. They are kept
under code numbers, not your name, so no-one can
find out what you have said.

We realise how sensitive and personal some of the
questions are, but it is important for scientific
research to find out what is happening to teenagers
and how they really think and feel.

You might want to talk to someone about some of the
subjects in this questionnaire, so we have included
details of confidential Helplines on a separate sheet.
