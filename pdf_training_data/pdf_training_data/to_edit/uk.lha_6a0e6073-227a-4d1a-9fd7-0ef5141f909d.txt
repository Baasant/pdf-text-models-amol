SMOKING

A lot has been said and written recently about smoking. To help settle some of the arguments we have been asked if we
would help by providing some facts and figures about the number of people who smoke, and how much they smoke.

If we can find out the facts about the 5,000 men and women in this survey, then we can state confidently what is true for
twenty-year-old people in Britain. The actual questions here are exactly the same as those used in several large inter-
national studies of smoking habits.

As you see, it is very important that our information should be correct, so we hope you will try to be as accurate as possible.
If you don’t know an answer exactly, please answer it as nearly as you can.
