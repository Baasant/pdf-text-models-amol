INTRODUCTORY NOTES

In 1958 a study was made of virtually every baby born in the week 3rd to 9th March in England, Scotland ind Wales.
Through the co-operation of doctors and midwives all over the country, very comprehensive information was obtained about
each child and mother, The results of this study, the 19$8 Perinatal Mortality Survey, have already had a considerable
impact with a consequent improvement in maternity services and a saving of infant life.

With so much information already available about the children, a unique opportunity presents itself now for relating the
ante-natal and birth history of the children to their present development. There is as yst much to Icarn about the influence
of conditions before and at birth on normal educational, physical and emotional growth. There is, too, much to be discovered
about the causes and effects of many handicaps and even about their incidence in the child population. Particularly is this
the case for minor handicaps, which may nevertheless be educationally significant. A detailed study of a large and representa-
tive group affords the opportunity of answering some of these questions.

   

 




 

2

To make the fullest use of this opportunity, an interdisciplinary project. the National Child Development Study (1958
Cohori) is being sponsored by the four organisations detailed on the front of this booklet. The present phase of this study,
which will cover some 16,000 children, is being financed from Government funds. [tis inevitable in an undertaking of this
size that a good deal of the information to be obtained will be gathered by individual doctors, health visitors, head and class
teachers. We are most grateful for the assurances which have already been reccived that maximum co-operation will be given
to this study. We do not underestimate the amount of work involved but we hope that you will feel the project worthy of your
professional skill and time.

It has been decided to collect information, if possible, from three sources. The school will make an assessment of the
child's progress, and give a few attainment tests. The mother of the child is to be interviewed and the Parental Questionnaire
completed by, in most cases, a health visitor. Finally, we hope that the child can be examined by a doctor, who will complete
the Medical Questionnaire.

The Parental Questionnaire

This questionnaire would best be completed during an interview with the child’s mother. {f for any reason the mother
is unavailable, please interview the person who can best answer questions about the child's health and development. Occasion-
ally, a child will not now be living with his own (i.e. natural) mother. In this circumstance, please interview the person who
has become for the child a, more or less, permancnt mother substitute, Throughout the questionnaire the term “mother”
should be taken to imply the child's mother or the permanent mother substitute, except on those few occasions where the term
“own mother” is used. The word “father" refers to the child's father or, where appropriate, to the male head of the
household.

In interviewing the mother, picase assure her at the outset that her answers will be treated in the strictest confidence and
that the 16,000 children concerned will be identified by numbers only. If in the light of the mother’s response during the
interview you feel that a particular question might best be omitted, please feel free to do this, although we are anxious to
have the questionnaires fully completed.

Most of the questionnaire has been framed as a serics of items to which a number of possible answers is stated.
Would you please ring the number in the column opposite the answer you wish to make. We have tried to anticipate likely
answers but, where appropriate, have left space for other replics. We apologise to those who may find this approach inhibit-
ing; it has been used to reduce your clerical work and ours. St also simplifies later analysis of the replies. If, however, you
feel that a particular answer needs some qualification or amplification, please add comments at that point on the questionnaire.

We should like you to complete the last page of the questionnaire after the laterview, The information given on this page
will be treated Uke all the other information, in the strictest confidence.
