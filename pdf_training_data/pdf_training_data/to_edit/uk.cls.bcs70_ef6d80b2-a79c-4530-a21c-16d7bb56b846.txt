To the Mother or person completing this form:

This national survey is about the health and education of children whose tenth birthday is between the Sth - 11th April.
In this form we are asking your help in telling us about the activities, skills and behaviour of your child and in answering a
few questions about your own health. All information will be treated in the strictest confidence and no names will ever be
divulged under any circumstances whatsoever.

Please note that the questions are addressed to the mother; this is for convenience as it will be the mother answering the
questions in the vast majority of cases; however, please do not let the actual wording of the questions interfere with the
completion of the form if the mother is not the person filling it in.

If you should have any difficulty in filling in any part of the form, please consult the Health Visitor, School Nurse or other
study representative who gave it to you.

- Most of the questions can be answered by ticking the box beside the relevant answer.

EXAMPLES:
Does your child belong to a club at school?

Yes ............. This indicates that your child does belong to a club at school.

Has your child ever been on a train journey on his/her own?

No..............
Yes eee ee eeeeee [A] #t Ves, how many times?
Once ... 2. eee eee eens OO
More than once This indicates that your child has been on a train journey on
uae ees his/her own more than once.

Some questions require a number for the answer.

to a club for 9 months.
For all answers requiring text it would be most helpful if you would use BLOCK CAPITALS.
