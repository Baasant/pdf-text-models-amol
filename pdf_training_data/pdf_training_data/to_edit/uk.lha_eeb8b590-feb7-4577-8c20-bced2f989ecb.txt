QUESTIONNAIRE ON SCHOOLS ATTENDED BY SURVEY CHILDREN

NATIONAL SURVEY OF THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN

JOINT COMMITTEE

INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH (UNIVERSITY OF LONDON)
SOCIETY OF MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH AND POPULATION INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE
LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, 13, ENDSLEIGH STREET, LONDON, W.C.1.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

The children enrolled in this national survey are now reaching the age when they will be moving from primary to secondary schools.
The Joint Committee feels that, before this change is made, some uniform assessment of their progress is desirable and for this reason
the accompanying tests (Forms N.F.3) are being given to each survey child. The purpose of the present form (S.5a) is to supplement
the tests by providing essential background information about the schools themselves.

The Joint Committee is most grateful for the generous co-operation of the primary schools in this inquiry, and as this is likely to be
the last approach that will be made to them, they hope very much that all Head Teachers will be able to provide this information.

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM

To reduce the amount of clerical work the answers to many of the questions are pre-coded. Al that is required is to put a circle
round the number opposite the appropriate answer. If no alternative fits, please write the answer in the space directly under the question.

There may be more than one survey child in your school, but since this form contains only general questions relating to the school,
it will only be necessary for you to fill in one S.5a. But it is essential that you enter on this form the full names and reference numbers
of all the survey children concerned. ‘These will be found on the accompanying test booklets and should be copied from there. When you
have filled in this form, please attach it to the test booklets and return it with them to the Director of Education.
