Introductory Notes

First of all may we take this chance to thank you
for carrying out these interviews on behalf of the
National Child Development Study

Quring the first few months of this year same 16,000
such interviews will be taking place. Ourmng the
same period the young pcople themselves will be
answering a questionnaire. campleting a few tests

of their educational atainment and they will be given
a full medical examination We shall also ask their
teachers and headteachers about the younq people's
schools and thes educational progress

if you helped us with earlier follow-ups of these
young people, you will know that this 1s the fourth
time that information has been coliected

At bicth, information was obtamed which Casi light

on such matters as perinatal mortality, the significance
of birthweight, the effect of mothers’ smoking in
preqnancy and many other important details with
consequent improvement in the Maternity Services

The findings of the folow-un when the children

were aged seven have recently been published in
From Buth to Seven (Davie. Butler & Goldsicin,
1972), The overwhelming co-operation received

from health visitors, teachers, medical officers, parents
and many others enabled this repart ta present more
findings which have been recoqnised as having
important mplicaiions for policy and planning
decisions for future mecheal, educational and social
services.

A simular follove-up was cared out at 11 years of age
and many of the results from this are now being
published. A full list of al! NCOS books, articles and
papers can be obtained from the National Children’s
Bureau.

Now ‘that the young people in the study are 16 years
of age, the opporunity is being taken to extend
the study as they reach school leaving aqe

Tho Interview

Ideally the interview should be with the child's
mother or mother-figure by herself (apart from those
few cases where there is none). However, this cannot
always be possible and it 1s important to avoid

P2

embarrassment and awkwardness thet might be
caused by asking someone else to leave

In Our preparatory work on the intensew form, we
have toed to svuid questions which would be
resented by the person being interniewed for being
too personal However. it 1s always possible that
people do not wart to answer some questions for
reasons of this kind Please stress al the start of the
Interview that people are free to dechae to answer
some Questions uf they choose and do nut press tor
