INTRODUCTION

The questionnaire which follows covers the educational and social environment of the
study child as seen by the Class Teacher and School Head. A number of questions also
assess the child’s educational and other characteristics.

A fair and objective assessment of the facts and behaviours referred to in the document
will be of considerable use in the fields of research and intervention and may help to
guide the teaching of future generations.

Four areas are covered in the questionnaire. These are:

A. The child's educational status, as seen by the teacher. This provides information
related to the educational, cognitive and motivational assessments to be carried out

separately.

B. The child’s social behaviour, as seen by the teacher. This information will be
related to both the child’s past home and school environments and to the future
potential of the child in teenage and adult society.

Cc. ild’ i as seen by the teacher. This will
focus in particular on behaviours and syndromes hypothesised to relate to perinatal
events and the early environment.

D. The child's educational environment, as seen by the School Head and teacher.
This will focus on classroom and curriculum factors and the educational ethos as

supported and interpreted by the teacher and the head.

C. CHILD’S DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIOURS
= EVEL OUFMIENTAL BEHAVIOURS
BE PLE "

In asking for your cooperation in describing the study child’s behaviour
within the categories described below we are not attempting to label

or find particular fault with this or any other study child. Rather

we are endeavouring to establish the links which are believed to exist
between the child’s birth and intervening medical and environmental
history and the present pattern of behaviour. We would again emphasise
our commitment to confidentiality, both of the child and the school, and
we hope you will find it possible to answer these questions as frankly and
fairly as possible.

Criteria against which the sample child’s behaviours are to be scored are
the ‘average’ behaviours of most children of a similar age. These items
should be scored against your knowledge of the child — not by asking the
child to perform any behaviours.

Unless otherwise.stated, put a vertical mark at the appropriate point on
each line to indicate the level of the particular behaviour (see page 2
for guidance). A fictional example implying that the child acts
carelessly a lot of the time follows’

In a number of the following items, reference is made to a concept of

to

assess, as accurately as possible, the input of different levels of professional
and lay resources into the class teaching situation of 10-year olds in Britain.
Thus the above concept refers specifically to the hours of formal academic
class activities. Items elsewhére in the questionnaire refer to time spent at
Assembly and on sporting and other activities which are also clearly educa-

tional but are not seen as “teaching time’ in the ordinary sense.
The abbreviation weekly time refers to weekly class teaching time.

Please estimate the total number of hours that can be defined *
