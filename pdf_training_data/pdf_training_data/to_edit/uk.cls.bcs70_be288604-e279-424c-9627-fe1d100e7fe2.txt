Now we have some questions about you and how you feel about yourself.  
 
Each question describes two types of young people.  For each question, we want you to choose which 
type of young person is most like you. 
 
When you have decided which of the two types of young people is most like you, tick the box that says 
how true that description is for you: is it really true or sort of true for you? 
 
For example, if you really don’t like any sports then you should tick as shown below – you don’t like 
sport and it is really true for you. 
 
        

 
 
These questions are taken from “The Perceived Competence Scale for Children”, devised 
by Susan Harter. For further details refer to Child Development, Vol. 53, No. 1. (Feb, 
1982), pp. 87-97. Also see ‘BCS70pc_10to16HarterQs.doc’ on the CLS website (maybe
