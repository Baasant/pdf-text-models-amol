LOOKING   AFTER   THE   BABY

This questionnaire is for the person who is mostly responsible for
looking after the study baby.

It asks about your lifestyle as your baby is getting older. Your answers
will help us understand what problems babies and their mothers have at
this stage.

The questionnaire asks you to answer a number of questions and give your
opinion about some ideas about caring for a baby. To answer simply
tick the box which is most accurate in your opinion.

Some questions may seem similar, but they are not the same. Others will
be the same as you have answered in earlier questionnaires. This is so
that we can see how things may have changed for you.

Please answer all questions if you can even if they are similar. There
are no right or wrong answers. Just tell us what you really think. All
answers are confidential.

 When you have finished you may make comments at the end.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP
