Ifa child has moved to another school this form should be returned to the Director of Education and not sent directly to the new school.
EXPLANATORY NOTE.

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey of the health, growth and development of children. With the help of his parents
and of health visitors, school nurses and teachers, a detailed account has been obtained of his health and development during the past
tenyears. Particularly valuable information has been obtained from the special records of school absences kept during the primary school
period, and the Joint Committee now feel that these should be supplemented by further information about the school background and the
child’s behaviour in school. They are therefore asking teachers to answer the following questions from their own knowledge of the
child. The value of this inquiry depends on information being obtained for every possible child. During the past ten years only 6 per
cent. of the original sample have been lost. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM

To reduce the amount of clerical work, this form has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one
of several printed alternatives. All that is required is to put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly
describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly, if you feel

that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information
you can give us.
