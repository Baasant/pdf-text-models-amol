DIET DIARY

We would be grateful if you could keep this diary of everything you eat or drink
over the next five days. The nurse will show you how to keep the diary and leave an
example to help you.

As you will see, each day is clearly marked, beginning with the first thing in the
morning and ending with food and drink at bedtime. Please treat each day
separately. Write in the name of all food and drink taken, a description if necessary
and the amount, for each part of the day. If nothing was eaten or drunk during a
part of the day, draw a line through that section. Record everything at the time of
eating, NOT from memory at the end of the day.

Overleaf is a list of popular foods and drinks. Next to each item is the sort of
thing we need to know so that we can tell what it is made of and how much you
had. This list cannot cover all the foods and drinks that people may have, so try
to relate to a similar item if any you have eaten are missing.

For some foods, you may find it easier to describe how much you had by
comparing it to one of the pictures.

Many packet foods have weights printed on them, so please use these whenever
possible.

At the end are some notes on recording made up dishes and foreign foods.

At the end of each day, there is a list of snacks and drinks that can easily be
forgotten. If not already mentioned in some other part of the day, please write
any extra items in here.

When the last day has been filled in, post the booklet back to us in the envelope
provided.

It is very important that you do not adjust what you eat and drink just because you
are keeping a record. Please stick to your usual diet!

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
