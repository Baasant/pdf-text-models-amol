INTRODUCTORY NOTES

First, may we take this opportunity to thank you for carrying out these interviews on behalf of Youthscan. We are gratefu!
to Health and Education Authorities throughout England. Wales and Scotland without whose co-operation this study °
would not have been possible. It is about current issues concerning the health and welfare of all teenagers and their
families.

The Interview

It is hoped that this Form will be completed in an interview with the child’s mother. If for any reason the mother is
unavailable, please interview the person who can best answer questions about the teenager’s health and development.
Sometimes the teenager wil! not be living with his/her awn (i.e. natural) mother. In this case the term mother throughout
the form should be taken to imply present mother figure and similarly father should be taken to imply present father figure.

In interviewing the mother please assure her at the outset that her answers will be treated in the strictest confidence and
that the 16,000 teenagers concerned will not be identified by name. Please ask the questions in the way you consider to
be the most appropriate to obtain the information required. If in the light of the mother’s response during the interview
you feel that a particular question might be best omitted, please feel free to do this although ideally we should tike to have
all interviews fully completed.

PLEASE ENSURE THAT EVERY QUESTION IS ANSWERED
Each question requires only one answer unless indicated otherwise. Most questions can be answered by ticking the box
beside the relevant response. Other questions require a number for the answer.

Example:

How long has study child lived at his/her present address?
Under six months... 2... O

Six months toa year... . O .
More thanayear ...... a How many years?

please specify 3 years

 

This means that the child has lived at the present address for 3 years

For all answers requiring text it would be most helpful if you would use BLOCK CAPITALS

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
