EXPLANATORY NOTE

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey of the health, growth and development of children. With the help
of his parents and of health visitors, school nurses and teachers, a detailed account has been obtained of his health and
development during the past 15 years. The survey children come from all types of home and are attending all types of
school both independent and Local Authority. Only 10 per cent have been lost and the value of this inquiry depends on

our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child.

All information given will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility that the name of any child

or school will appear in any report.
