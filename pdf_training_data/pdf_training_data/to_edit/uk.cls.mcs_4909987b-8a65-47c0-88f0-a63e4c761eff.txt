NCDSAPP    Finally – we’d like to ask you to download a COVID-19 Symptoms Tracker 

app.    Many people are recording symptoms of COVID-19 using specially designed symptom 

tracker apps. These are helping to slow the outbreak, by recording which symptoms are most 

common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK.      As a member of NCDS you can play a 

special role.  We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom 

tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app 

to be combined with the information held by NCDS.       All you need to do is to download the 

app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been 

recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be 

linked.      Please click HERE to download the app.       You can download the symptoms 

tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time.  You can also find the link to download
