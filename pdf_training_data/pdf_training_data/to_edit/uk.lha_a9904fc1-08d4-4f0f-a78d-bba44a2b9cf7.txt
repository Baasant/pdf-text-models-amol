EXPLANATORY NOTE

The student named above is a member of this national sample of 5,000 young people who have been followed up
since their birth in 1946, through the generous co-operation of Local Education Authorities, schools, the Youth Employ-
ment Service, health visitors and colleges. We are now trying to collect a little information about the further studies of the
sample members, so that we can have accurate information about their educational attainment.

We believe, either from a form completed by the college in 1968, or from information supplied by the student, that he
attended your college in the sessions 1968/69 or 1969/70. We should be most grateful if you would provide us with
information about the course and his performance EVEN IF HE DID NOT COMPLETE THE SESSION. Since all the
information which we require will be in the college's records, no direct contact with the student will be required.

All information will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility of the name of the college, or of
the student, appearing in any report.

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM

We would ask that this form be completed by the Head of Department concerned. Where a question has several possible
answers, please circle the number opposite the appropriate reply. If you feel that further amplification of any reply is
needed, please do not hesitate to give it. Please put your answers in the column appropriate to the session 1968/69 or

1969/70.

If the student did not enrol at this college in these two years but you know he went on to another college, please
insert the name of the new college at the top of the form and return it for re-allocation.

When the form is completed please return it by the end of November 1970, tothe National Survey of Healthand Develop-
ment, 20 Hanway Place, London WIP OAJ.
