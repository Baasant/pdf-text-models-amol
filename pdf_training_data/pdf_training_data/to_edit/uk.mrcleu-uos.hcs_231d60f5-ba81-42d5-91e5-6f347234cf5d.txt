How to fill in your diary: 
 

 Write down in this diary every time you have a snack, drink, or 

meal.  Include the following: 

 

 THE TIME 

 

 THE TYPE OF FOOD OR DRINK 

 

Use brand names where possible for example, Tesco’s salt & 

vinegar crisps, Wall’s Viennetta 

 

For cooked food write which cooking method was used, for 

example: fried, deep fat fried, roast, boiled, micro-waved or 

baked.  Also write down the brand of oil or fat used to fry/roast  

 

If you had a home made dish, for example chilli con carne, 

please list the main ingredients such as mince, onions, red 

kidney beans, and tinned tomatoes

a cheese sandwich is really three foods 

 

2 slices white bread sandwich 

1 slice Kraft cheese

Please say which type of milk is used each time –  

skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole 

and pasteurised (fresh), UHT, dried or condensed.

much detail as possible.
