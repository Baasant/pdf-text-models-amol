Girl Teenager questionnaire

GROWING AND CHANGING (7)

You may have seen this type of questionnaire before.

There are important changes to a teenager's body that can
happen as early as 6 or as late as 20. At this time of life we
have some questions we need to ask and which we need to hear
about at regular intervals.

Use a BLACK or BLUE pen when you fill in the
questionnaire.

Please read carefully the instructions on page 3.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT

We would like to assess the stage of your physical development using the drawings
on the next pages. These show various stages commonly used by doctors to assess
the growth and development of girls.

We need to know which drawings most closely match
your stage of development at the moment.

Not all teenagers follow the same pattern of development.
Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.

The nipple is raised a little in
this stage. The rest of the
breast is still flat.

This is the breast bud stage. In this
stage the nipple is raised more than in
stage 1. The breast is a small mound.
The dark area around the nipple
(areola) is larger than in stage 1.

The areola and the breast are both
larger than in stage 2. The areola does
not stick out away from the breast

The areola and the nipple make up a
mound that sticks up above the shape
of the breast. (Note: This stage may not
happen at all for some teenagers. Some
teenagers develop from stage 3 to stage
5 with no stage 4.)

This is the mature adult stage. The
breasts are fully developed. Only the
nipple sticks out in this stage. The
areola has moved back in the general
shape of the breast.

Section B

The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A teenager can
go through each of the five stages shown, although some teenagers skip some
stages. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read the
descriptions.

Cross the box that is closest to your current breast stage

Section C

The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A
teenager can go through each of the five stages shown. Please look at
each of the drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions.

Cross the box that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair you have.

There is no pubic hair

There is a little long, lightly coloured hair.
This hair may be straight or a little curly.

The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser
and more curled. It has spread out and thinly
covers a bigger area.

The hair is now as dark, curly, and coarse as
that of an adult woman. However, the area
that the hair covers is not as large as that of
an adult woman. The hair has not spread out
to the legs.

The hair now is like that of an adult woman.
It also covers the same area as that of an
adult woman. The hair usually forms a
triangular pattern as it spreads out to the
legs.

NOTE: Your pubic hair stage may or may not be the same as
your stage of breast development.
