This questionnaire is for the study child’s father or person who 
takes the role of father. This could be the mother’s husband or partner. 
The answers will help us to identify those problems that may be helped 
by changes in the health care system. 

 To answer simply tick the box which is most accurate in your 
opinion. 

 Some questions are the same as those you have answered before.  
This is so that we can tell what changes have happened to you. 

 Please answer all questions if you can, even if they are similar.  If 
you do not want to answer a question or if it does not apply to you, put a 
line through it.  There are no good or bad answers.  Just tell us what is 
true for you.

E1.  I often feel uncomfortable and  
       ill at ease for no real reason 
   
E2.  I’m always keen on trying out   
       things that are all new 
   
E3.  Sometimes people bother me  
       just by being around 
   
E4.  I often have aches in my   
       shoulders and in the back of my  
       neck 
   
E5.  I have had more than my share  
       of things to worry about 
   
E6.  No matter whom I’m talking to  
       I'm always polite and courteous 
   
E7.  I find it hard to object if I’m 
       neglected at, for example,  
       a restaurant 
   
E8.  I have a tendency to act on the   
       spur of the moment without 
       really thinking ahead

       often have great difficulty  
       getting my point across 
   
E10. Sometimes I used to feel that I   
        would like to leave home

E77.  I sometimes wanted to run   
         away from home  
   
E78.  I feel best when I keep people   
         at a distance  
   
E79.  I sometimes wish that I could   
         speak up when I dislike   
         something 
   
E80.  I can usually concentrate on   
         what I’m doing even if the   
          environment is distracting 
   
E81.  I usually “talk before I think”   
          
   
E82.  I usually don’t feel at ease    
         when I meet people I don’t   
          know too well                  Never seen 
            a fight 
E83.  I feel very ill at ease when   
         witnessing a fight in the street  
   
E84.  In a way I like to do routine   
         jobs  
   
E85.  I have often got into trouble   
         even when it was not my fault  
   
E86.  Sometimes when upset, I    
         suddenly feel as if my legs   
         were too weak to carry me 
   
E87.  I sometimes spread gossip    
         about people I don’t like  
   
E88.  I have difficulty sitting in a    
         relaxed position even in a   
         comfortable chair

          it’s pretty hard to keep up hope 
          of getting anywhere                           Have never 
                       cheated 
E91.  The few times I’ve cheated I 
          have suffered unbearable  
          feelings of remorse 
   
E92.  I prefer to avoid involving  
         myself in other people’s  
         personal problems 
   
E93.  I easily feel pressure when I’m 
         urged to speed up 
   
E94.  Rather often, especially when 
         I’m tired, I get a feeling of  
         unreality - that either I or the  
         world around me is changing  
   
E95.  I can’t help getting into  
         arguments when people  
         disagree with me 
   
E96.  When I don’t know something 
          I don’t at all mind admitting it 
   
E97.  I often worry about things that 
         other people look upon as  
         trifles 
   
E98.  As a youngster in school I  
         used to give the teacher lots  
         of trouble 
   
E99.  I can’t help being a little rude 
         to people I don’t like 
   
E100.  My hands usually tremble

           decision I usually make it 
           quickly

E102.  I like doing things just for  
           the thrill of it 
   
E103.  There are a number of people 
            who seem to be jealous of me 
   
E104.  My parents never really 
           understood me 
   
E105.  People generally think that I 
           hide my feelings so that they 
           have difficulties in 
           understanding me 
   
E106.  I like to have plenty of time 
           available when I’m doing 
           something 
   
E107.  I seldom feel that people are 
           trying to anger or insult me 
   
E108.  My muscles are so tense that 
           I get tired 
   
E109.  To be on the move, travelling, 
           change and excitement –  
           that’s the kind of life I like 
   
E110.  I worry far in advance of 
           when I’m going to get started  
           on something 
   
E111.  I’m always patient with others 
           
   
E112.  I seem to do things that I  
           regret more often than other  
           people do 
   
E113.  I take life easy

E114.  There have been times when  
           I was quite jealous of the  
          good fortune of others 
   
E115.  I don’t let a lot of unimportant 
           things irritate me

E116.  Sometimes my cheeks burn 
           even if it isn’t particularly hot 
   
E117.  When I was going to school I  
          skived off (truanted) quite often 
   
E118.  I consider myself reserved 
           and a little cold rather than 
           kind and warm 
   
E119.  I tend to be on my guard with 
           people who are somewhat  
           more friendly than I expected 
   
E120.  I feel calm and secure even 
           when I’m facing new tasks 
   
E121.  After buying something I 
           often worry about having  
            made the wrong choice 
   
E122.  I have lied sometimes to get 
           out of something 
   
E123.  If somebody annoys me, I’m 
           apt to tell them what I think 
           of them 
   
E124.  I sometimes have a feeling  
           that I don’t get enough air 
           to breathe 
 
E125.  My parents generally allowed  
           me to make my own decisions 
   
E126.  When I get mad I say nasty 
           things

E127.  I consider myself an  
           impulsive person 
   
E128.  In the late afternoon I often 
           get a headache which feels as 
           if there was an iron-band

           across my forehead 
   
E129.  When people yell at me I   
           yell back 
   
E130.  When listening to music on  
           the radio I want it really loud  
           so that I can feel “turned on” 
   
E131.  I often feel as though I have 
           done something wrong or 
           wicked 
   
E132.  When I’m angry, I sometimes  
           sulk 
   
E133.  People often come to me with  
           their troubles 
   
E134.  I think I get tired more easily 
           than most people I know 
   
E135.  If someone is scolding me, I  
           become sad rather than angry
