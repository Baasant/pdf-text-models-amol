IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF
THE NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER
THE LAST ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. IN EITHER CASE
RETURN THE FORM TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.

Purpose of this inquiry

This is the last home visit in connection with the National Survey of Child Health; and its purpose is to bring the medical and
social history up to date and to fill in gaps in our information about the child’s progress at school and the job he/she will enter on
leaving school. We are also asking about the parents’ health including questions both on known illnesses and on their general well-being.
This proves to be important in relation to the health and adjustment of their children. During the 15 years of this survey we have kept
in touch with over 90 per cent of the parents and children. As the value of this inquiry depends on information being obtained for
every possible survey child we hope that on this last occasion all forms will be completed.

COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO THE
JOINT COMMITTEE.

THIS INQUIRY REFERS THROUGHOUT TO THE CHILD BORN IN MARCH 1946. RING THE CODE
NUMBER OPPOSITE THE MOTHER’S ANSWER. IF A QUESTION DOES NOT APPLY, STRIKE IT THROUGH.
