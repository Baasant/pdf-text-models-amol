IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF
THE NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER
THE LAST ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. IN EITHER CASE
RETURN THE FORM TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.

Purpose of this inquiry

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of
Medical Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. Details of health and development have been recorded at two yearly intervals
during the pre-school years and it is hoped that, during the primary school period, a clinical examination will be made by the School Doctor each year and
a record of illnesses made each term by the School Nurse. The aim of the present examination is to bring the medical and social history up to date, to
check information previously noted, and to record the clinical state of the child. This will complete our information for the whole of the pre-school period.

The children in this sample are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in March 1946. They are drawn from all social
classes and during the first six years of their lives only 5% of the original sample have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information being
obtained for every possible survey child. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

This form refers to the medical history and clinical examination only. Details of the home conditions and of certain past illnesses and accidents
are being recorded by the School Nurse or Health Visitor on a separate sheet.

How to fill in this form.

Six thousand children scattered all over the country, are being given this examination, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of
doctors who are examining them should record their findings in a comparable way. For this reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this
examination form has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several printed alternatives. All that is required is to
put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write the answer in the
space directly under the question. Similarly if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your findings, we should be
most grateful for any further information you can give us. When a question does not apply it should be struck through. When either the Doctor or the
Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact should be recorded in the space directly under the question.

 

In order to ensure that these many medical histories are obtained in the same way it is important, when questioning the parent that the wording
and order of this form should be adhered to.

COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO
THE JOINT COMMITTEE

If this child has died please state If this child is living but the form cannot be completed please

state the reason here:
