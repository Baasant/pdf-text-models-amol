MATERNITY SURVEY

ROYAL COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS © GYNAECOLOGISTS
AND THE POPULATION INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE

69, ECCLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W. 1

 

TELL THE MOTHER :—

That thousands of mothers all over the country are being asked these questions.

2. That by giving details as to how much it has cost her to have this baby and to clothe it, she will be helping us to
work out ways in which the medical and other expenses of bearing children may be lightened.

3. That all information she gives will be regarded as absolutely confidential. °

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM.

 

1. The questions are printed in light type and the mothers’ answers in small capitals. Instructions to the interviewer
are in italics.

2. The answers to the questions are shown by putting a ring with a soft pencil round the code number or letter
opposite the mother’s answer. If the answer does not fit any alternative, write it below the question itself. When
comments or opinions are asked for, as far as possible write down the mother’s own words. If the mother refuses
to answer any question put a ring round “X” for “No answer.”

3. Before you interview the mother, read through the questionnaire and answer as many questions as possible from
your records and those of the midwife and sanitary department. However, check all answers you have obtained
from the records with the mother when you interview her.

4 It will probably be most convenient to make an appointment with the mother for this interview. If she refuses
to be interviewed, try to find out her reasons and write them in the space provided. Then fill in as much of the
questionnaire as you can from the records, the essential items to obtain being the mother’s age (6), number of
a (15), whether she attended for ante-natal care (19), where she was confined (22), and occupation of her

usband (48).

IT IS AS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET BACK REFUSALS AS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES, SO PLEASE
DO NOT DESTROY REFUSALS BUT RETURN THEM TO US.

5. Please follow the order of the questions as "set out in the questionnaire and keep as close to the phrasing as you
can. When any question does not apply to a particular mother, do not ask her it. In such cases do NOT ring
“xX” for “No answer,” but STRIKE RIGHT THROUGH THE QUESTION.

6. When interviewing a mother whose baby was still-born or has died since birth, use your own judgement: in leaving
out any questions that might embarrass her.

7. In filling in the cost questions, please do not bracket items together, but enter costs separately opposite each item.

8. Before leaving the mother, please check through the questionnaire to see that all relevant aeesaons have been
answered.

9. When you have completed this questionnaire, do NOT send it to London, but hand it, with any others you may
have, by May 10th, to whoever has been delegated by your Medical Officer of Health to receive them.
