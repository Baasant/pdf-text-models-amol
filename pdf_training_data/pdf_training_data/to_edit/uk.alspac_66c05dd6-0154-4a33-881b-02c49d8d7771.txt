Thank you for your help so far.

These next pages are concerned with early sexual experience.

IF YOU WOULD RATHER NOT ANSWER THEM, WE QUITE UNDERSTAND. JUST
STOP NOW AND SEND THE QUESTIONNAIRE BACK AS USUAL.

But it is possible that whether or not such events have taken
place they may be a vital clue in understanding some of the
problems we are trying to solve - even though they may appear
to be unconnected. If you feel you can help, we would be very
grateful.
