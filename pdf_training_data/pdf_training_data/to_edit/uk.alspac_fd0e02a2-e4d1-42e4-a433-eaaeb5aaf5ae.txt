If you do not want to answer a question or if it does not apply to you, 
put a line through it.   

There are no good or bad answers.  Just tell us what is true of your

The Children of the 90s study is in the forefront of new 
knowledge about children’s health! 

Over 100 scientific papers have been published or are in press in medical 
journals. 
 

None of this would have been possible without your valuable help.

SECTION C: TALKING 
 
Below are a number of statements about speech. Please indicate which are true for your study child. 
 

Certainly true Somewhat true Not true 
 
C1. People can understand almost  
 everything she says 
 
C2. People have trouble in understanding  
 much of what she says 
 
C3. She seldom makes any errors in   
 producing speech sounds 
 
C4. She mispronounces one or two speech   
 sounds but is not difficult to understand;  
 e.g. may say “th” for “s” or “w” for “r” 
 
C5. Her production of speech sounds seems   
 immature, like that of a younger child,  
 e.g. she says “tat” for “cat”, or “chimbley”  
 for “chimney”, or “bokkle” for “bottle” 
 
C6. She seems unable to produce several   
 sounds; e.g. “k” or “s”, so that “cat”  
 and “sat” are both pronounced as “tat” 
 
C7. She leaves off beginnings or ends of   

words, or omits entire syllables e.g.  
 “bella” for “umbrella” 
 
C8. It is much harder to understand her when  
 she is talking in sentences, rather than 
 just producing single words 
 
C9. Her speech is extremely rapid  
 
C10. She seems to have difficulty in constructing  
 the whole of what she wants to say: 
 makes false starts, and repeats whole   
 words and phrases; e.g. might say “can I- 
 can-I-can-can I have an-have an ice cream” 
 
C11. Her words are clearly spoken and they   
 flow one from another

 22

Certainly true Somewhat true Not true 
 
C12. Speech is mostly just 2 or 3 word   
 phrases such as “me got ball” or  
 “give dolly” 
 
C13. She can produce long and complicated  
 sentences such as: “When we went to the 
 park I had a go on the swings”; “I saw this 
 man standing on the corner” 
 
C14. She tends to leave out words and  
 grammatical endings, such as: “I find two 
 dog”, “John go there yesterday”  
 
C15. Sometimes she makes mistakes with   
 pronouns, e.g. saying “she” rather than  
 “he” or vice versa 
 
C16. She talks to anyone and everyone  
 
C17. She talks too much  
 
C18. She keeps telling people things that they   
 know already 
 
C19. She talks to herself  
 
C20. She talks repetitively about things that  
 no-one is interested in 
 
C21. She asks questions although she knows   

the answers  
 
C22. It is sometimes hard to make sense of   
 what she is saying because it seems 
 illogical or disconnected 
 
C23. Conversation with her can be enjoyable 
 and interesting 
 
C24. She can give an easy-to-follow account   
 of a past event such as a birthday party or 
 holiday

 23

Certainly true Somewhat true Not true 
 
C25. She can talk clearly about what she plans   
 to do in the future e.g. tomorrow or next  
 week 
 
C26. She would have difficulty in explaining to   
 a younger child how to play a simple game 
 such as “snap” 
 
C27. She has difficulty in telling a story, or   
 describing what she has done in a 
 sequence of events 
 
C28. She uses terms like “he” or “it” without  
 making it clear what she is talking about 
 
C29. She doesn’t seem to realise the need to   
 explain what she is talking about to some- 
 one who doesn’t share her experiences;  

e.g. might talk about “Johnny” without  
explaining who he is 

 
C30. She pronounces words in an over-precise  
 manner: accent may sound rather affected 
 or “put-on”, as if child is mimicking a TV 
 personality rather than talking like those  
 around her 
 
C31. She makes frequent use of expressions  

such as “by the way”, “actually”, “you   
know what?”, “as a matter of fact”, “well you  
know” or “of course” 

 
C32. She will suddenly change the topic of  
 conversation 
 
C33. She often turns the conversation to a   
 favourite theme, rather than following 
 what the other person wants to talk about 
 
C34. Conversation with her tends to go off  
 in unexpected directions

Certainly true Somewhat true Not true 

 
C35. She includes over-precise information in   
 her talk, e.g. will give the exact time or 
 date of an event. e.g. when asked “when did you  
 go on holiday?” may say “13th July 1995” 
 rather than “in the summer” 
 
C36. She has favourite phrases, sentences or  

longer sequences which she will use a  
 great deal, sometimes in inappropriate situations 
 
C37. She sometimes seems to say things that   
 she does not fully understand 
 
C38. She tends to repeat back what others have   
 just said 
 
C39. Her ability to communicate clearly seems  
 to vary a great deal from one situation 
 to another 
 
C40. She takes in just one or two words in a  

sentence, and so often misinterprets what 
 has been said 
 
C41. She can understand sarcasm e.g. will be  
 amused rather than confused when some- 
 one says “isn’t it a lovely day!” when it is 
 pouring with rain 
 
C42. She tends to be over-literal, sometimes   
 with (unintentionally) funny results.   
 e.g. a child who was asked “Do you find it hard 
 to get up in the morning” replied “No, you 
 just put one leg out of the bed and then the other 
 and stand up”  
 
C43. She gets into trouble, because she doesn’t   
 always understand the rules for polite 
 behaviour, and is regarded by others as 
 rude or strange 
 
C44. She may say things which are tactless or  

socially inappropriate

 25

  Certainly true Somewhat true Not true 
 
C45. She treats everyone the same way,  
 regardless of social status: e.g. she might  

talk to the head teacher the same way as 
to another child 

 
C46. She ignores conversational overtures from  
 others e.g. if asked “what are you  

making?” the child just continues working 
as if nothing had happened 

 
C47. She hardly ever starts up a conversation;  

does not volunteer information about  
what has happened 

 
C48. She doesn’t seem to read facial expressions  
 or tone of voice and may not realise  
 when other people are upset or angry 
 
C49. She is poor at using facial expressions or  

gestures to convey her feelings; she may  
look blank when angry, or smile when anxious 

 
C50. She makes good use of gestures to get her   

meaning across  
 
C51. She seldom or never looks at the person  

she is talking to: seems to actively avoid   
eye contact 

 
C52. She tends to look away from the person  

she is talking to:  seems inattentive or 
preoccupied 

 
C53. She smiles appropriately when talking   

to people
