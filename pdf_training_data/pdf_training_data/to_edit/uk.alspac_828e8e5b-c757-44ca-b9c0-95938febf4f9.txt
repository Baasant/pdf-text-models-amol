Mother/Daughter Questionnaire 
 
 

       GROWING AND CHANGING (2) 

There are important changes to a girl’s body 
that can happen even as early as 6 or as late as 20. 

At this time in life we have some questions we need to ask 
and which we would appreciate hearing about. 

 
This questionnaire can be filled in by either mother or daughter. 

As always, if you don’t want to answer a question, put a line through it. 
 

Your answers will of course be kept in confidence and not attached to your name 

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
 

We would like to assess the stage of your daughter’s physical development using the 
drawings on the next pages. These indicate various stages of puberty commonly used by 
doctors to assess the growth and development of girls. 
 

We need to know which drawings most closely match  
your daughter’s stage of development at the moment. 

 
Not all children follow the same pattern of development. 

Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description. 
 
If there are any additional comments about your daughter’s physical growth and development 
that you would like to make, then please do so here:

SECTION B 
 
The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A girl can go through each 
of the five stages shown, although some girls skip some stages. Please look at each of the 
drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions. 
 
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is closest to your daughter’s current 
breast stage. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
      
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

This is the breast bud stage. In this stage the 
nipple is raised more than in stage 1. The 
breast is a small mound. The dark area 
around the nipple (areola) is larger than in 
stage 1. 

The areola and the breast are both larger 
than in stage 2. The areola does not stick 
out away from the breast. 

The areola and the nipple make up a mound 
that sticks up above the shape of the breast. 
(Note: This stage may not happen at all for 
some girls. Some girls develop from stage 3 
to stage 5 with no stage 4.) 

This is the mature adult stage. The breasts
are fully developed. Only the nipple sticks
out in this stage. The areola has moved
back in the general shape of the breast.

stage. The rest of the breast is still flat.

SECTION C 
 
The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A girl can go through 
each of the five stages shown. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read 
the descriptions. 
 
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair 
your daughter has. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
       Not sure 
 
 
NOTE: Your daughter’s pubic hair stage may or may not be the same as her stage of 
breast development. 

 

 

 

 

There is no pubic hair 

There is a little long, lightly coloured hair. This 
hair may be straight or a little curly. 

The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser and
more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a
bigger area. 

The hair is now as dark, curly, and coarse as that
of an adult woman. However, the area that the
hair covers is not as large as that of an adult
woman. The hair has not spread out to the legs. 

The hair now is like that of an adult woman. It 
also covers the same area as that of an adult 
woman. The hair usually forms a triangular 
pattern as it spreads out to the legs.
