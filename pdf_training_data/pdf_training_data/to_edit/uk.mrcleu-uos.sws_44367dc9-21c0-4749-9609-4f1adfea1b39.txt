1: ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE 
 Can I firstly ask you about your activity and exercise patterns over the last three months? As before, we 

would like you to divide up a “typical” day into three types of activity. These are: 

  (1) sleeping or lying,   (2) sitting, (3) standing or walking. 

 

 

1.1 Over a typical 24 hour day how many hours have you 

 generally spent sleeping or lying with your feet up?                 hrs       mins    

  

 (ask time usually go to bed & wake up, including any at work!) 

 

 This would indicate xx hours sitting or on your feet. 

 

1.2 Of those hours how many on a typical day have you spent sitting  

down?  (e.g. includes sitting at work, mealtimes, 

 driving, reading, watching TV)                                                                                        

               s       hrs      mins 

                                                                                               

1.3 This would mean that you have spent about xx hours a day on your feet.  Does this sound about right? 

                                                                                                                                          

                            hrs                 mins 

  

   

   

 



 

 
 

2 

 

 

 

 

  

1.4 Out of these xx hours spent on your feet, about how much of the time were you actively  

 on the move (rather than standing fairly still)? 

*  1. Very little 10% 

  2. Some  30% 

  3. About half 50% 

  4. Most  70% 

  5. Almost all 90% 

 

1.5 During the past three months, how often have you done the following kinds of 

 * exercise or activities? 

 

a)  strenuous exercise which made your heart beat rapidly AND left you breathless e.g. jogging, vigorous 

swimming or cycling, aerobics. 

      

           FFQ categories 1-7               >x1              

       

 and on average about how long did                 

 each period of activity last?            hrs            mins 

 

b) moderate exercise which left you exhausted but not breathless, e.g. brisk walking, dancing, easy 

swimming or cycling, badminton, sailing. 

 

     

          FFQ categories 1-7        >x1 

 
 and on average  about how long did 

 each period of activity last?            hrs                      mins   

  

 

c) gentle exercise  which left you tired but not exhausted, e.g.walking, heavy housework (including washing 

windows and polishing), gardening, DIY, golf. 

 

 

          FFQ categories 1-7                 >x1 

 

 and on average about how long did 

 each period of activity last?                              hrs            mins 

 

1.6 Which of the following best describes your walking speed at present? 

  *  1. Very slow 

  2. Stroll at an easy pace 

  3. Normal speed 

  4. Fairly brisk 

  5. Fast

2:  DIETARY QUESTIONS 
2.1 Now I am going to ask you about the foods you have eaten over the past 3 months. To do this I have a list of foods and I would like you to tell me how often 

you have eaten each food.  As before the list may include foods you never ate or you may find foods which you eat a lot are missing.  These can be added on at the 

end. (Define the 3 month period)
