historical background of the Study, a near-vision test sheet and some procedural details.

You will need the following equipment for the medical examination:

PROCEDURE: EQUIPMENT RECOMMENDED:

Height Steel/wooden measuring rod or steel tape measure. If not available, stadiometer on back of
weighing machine.

Weight Beam balance, or other weighing apparatus.

Head Circumference Paper or plastic-covered tape measure.

Distant Vision Standard Snelien Chart (or equivalent).

Near Vision Near Vision card of Sheridan-Gardiner type. reproduced in instruction booklet, by kind
permission of the author.

Blood Pressure Mercury sphygmomanometer: the bladder within the cuff should be deep enough to cover about

two-thirds of the length of upper arm and long enough to circle the arm completely. A cuff depth
of at least 4 ins. is advisable. An adult-size cuff is acceptable.

THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION IN RELATION TO REST OF TEN YEAR STUDY.

This is the first time these children have been examined medically for the Child Health and Education Study. Therefore this is
the first opportunity to identify definitively children with health problems, disabilities and handicap. Most but not all of the
cohort and their parents have already participated in this Study, either in the perinatal period, intermediately or at five years,
when the health visitors of your AHA carried out an extensive review of the children’s health, development and pre-school day
care. Parents have now received a letter explaining the 10 year Study and inviting their co-operation and ensuring them of
confidentiality. The vast majority of the parents are being interviewed by a schoo! nurse or health visitor, either at home or at
the medical examination just prior to your clinical examination. This is for completion of a Parental Interview Form in which the
child's past medical, social and family history is being elicited. The schoo! nurse or health visitor has bean asked if possible to
ensure the availability of the completed form in time for you to study the medical history before the time of the medical
examination. The parent(s) will have been invited to attend the medical examination, though they will clearly not attend in
every case. The parent(s) will also have been asked to complete a Matema/ Self-completion Form giving details of any
behavioural difficulties in their child including the Rutter Child Behavioural Scale. Your Local Education Authority (Regional
Council, Scotland) is arranging for a separate schoo! educational assessment of each child, including tests of reading,
mathematics, verbal comprehension and reasoning ability: from this, it will be possible to identify slow learners and children

with educational as well as health problems.

THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION FORM IS IN THREE SECTIONS.

Section A. School Health

In order to complete this section fully, you will need to assemble a// the child’s schoo! medical records and a// other relevant
school health and educational documents. You are asked to pay Particular attention to assembling complete records of any
child who is handicapped or receiving special education, as you will be asked to provide a summary from the notes of the
progress and current status of each such child. Even if only partial records are accessible to you, please complete all Sections
of this questionnaire as far as possible at the time of the medical examination from all sources available. Your Specialist in
Community Medicine (Child Health) has been asked to supply further information if extra records are available centrally.

Section B: The Medicai Examination

Please make sure that the recommended equipment is available. Please read carefully the medical history in the Parental
Interview Form, if this has already been completed. Please read through the medical questions carefully before the
examination. If you have time, please try out the co-ordination tests in advance. The medical examination is structured to
provide the maximum information while leaving you free to conduct the clinical examination in any way you find optimal. Tests
such as distant and near vision and measurements of height, weight and head circumference appear early in Section B of the
medical examination form, in case it proves more expedient to carry these out just prior to the actual! clinical examination.
Please undertake the necessary measurements, however, in the order which best suits the facilities available to you and
anyone helping you with the examination. You are asked to summarise your findings at the end of the examination, and also to
indicate whether the examination has brought to light any new findings.

Section C: The Audiogram.

The Audiogram is on the last sheet of the examination form and is detachable. It is presumed that this will be done by sweep
audiometry though the form contains space in case pure-tone audiometry is used. You are asked to record whether the results
of sweep audiometry are normal or abnormal. If sweep results are abnormal, please arrange to jet us have details of pure-tone

audiometry.

FILLING IN THE EXAMINATION FORM

Questions are usually answered by TICKING the appropriate box alongside the correct answer. In some cases, a brief written
answer in clear script or capitals may also be appropriate ina space which is indicated. An example of the correct way to fill in

the form is shown below:—

Has colour vision ever been tested?

When filling in the form please try to ensure that an answer of some sort has been ticked for every question — even if it is only
‘unable to assess’. Negative answers are as important as positive ones.

FOR ALL ANSWERS REQUIRING TEXT IT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL IF YOU WOULD WRITE VERY CLEARLY OR
ALTERNATIVELY USE BLOCK CAPITALS.

HEIGHT

B17. Recommended technique:
Please position the child upright against a flat wall or a door. Encourage him/her to stretch to full height, keeping
heels on floor. Heels and buttocks should be flush against wall or door. Piace a hardbound book on the child's head.
Mark the position of the lower edge with a pencil and then measure the height from the ground with a wood or steel!
measuring rod or steel tape measure. Alternatively, use measuring device on the back of a weighing machine and
observe precautions as above.

(a) Height in cm, to nearest 0.1 cm.... MEI? ran [ems.]

BLOOD PRESSURE

B20. “lease postpone to later in examination if you feel child is nervous.
Sphygmomanometer cuff must have bladder long enough to encircle the arm completely and be wide enough to
cover two-thirds of the length of the upper arm. Please record below the depth of cuff used. The cuff should
preferably be at least 4 inches deep.

It is realised that you will be experienced in taking blood pressures, but we ask you to follow the instructions
closely for uniformity: —

Sit child on chair in as relaxed a state as possible. Wrap the cuff around the right upper arm, placing the rubber
tubes from the biadder posteriorly, for ease of access to right antecubital fossa. Palpate the right radial pulse and
inflate the cuff to about 30mm.Hg. above the disappearance of the pulse. Slowly deflate till the pulse reappears.
Deflate the cuff.

Place the stethoscope in the antecubital fossa over the brachial artery, but not in contact with any part of the cuff.
Rapidly inflate the cuff to about 30mm.Hg. above the systolic pressure and than deflate at a rate of 2—3mm.Hg. per
second.

The appearance of faint clear tapping sounds for 2 consecutive beats should be recorded as the Systolic Pressure.
Continue to deflate the cuff and the sounds will soften or may become swishing, then sharper sounds will reappear.
With continuing deflation, there will be a sudden muffling of sounds, which will become soft and blowing. This is

Korotkoff's 4th sound and represents the Diastolic Pressure. Do not wait until the point of complete disappearance of
sounds. 10

MOTOR CO-ORDINATION TESTS

The following five tests will indicate the clumsy or inco-ordinate child so far as this is possible on clinical examination. Such
tests are non-specific and difficult to validate, but will be used in conjunction with other findings and the opinions of teachers
and parents, recorded elsewhere. The results will inevitably be influenced by the effects of childs skill and experience. At the
end of the tests the examiner is asked to give a considered opinion as to the degree of clumsiness or inco-ordination.

Please test all children except either those who are grossly handicapped or those who are incapable of understanding the
test(s}. In these instances, please enter the reason after question B32.

B28. THROWING A BALL IN THE AIR
‘You will need a tennis ball. or a rubber ball of equivalent size and weight.
The important point about this test is to discover the child's optimum performance. We would therefore be grateful
if you would carry out the test in the following way:—
Ask the child to stand in a space so that he/she has room to move. Say ‘I want you to show me if you can throw the
ball up in the air and catch it’. Allow two or three initial attempts. If the child fails to catch the ball, record the fact
and do not proceed with the test.
If the child can catch the ball, say ‘Now throw the ball up in the air and clap your hands together once before you
catch it’. praising the child if he/she both claps his/her hands and catches the ball. Then repeat the procedure
increasing the number of claps until the child fails on two successive attempts. Record the greatest number of
claps resulting in a successful catch.

if the greatest number of claps was 2 or more, ask him/her to repeat the test, catching with one hand only. Let the

child use preferred hand.

RECORD:— Tick correct answer

If caught ball after at least 2 claps, please continue test BI .3
catching the ball with the preferred hand, and record the [claps]

maximum number of claps before catching with preferred hand....

B29. SORTING MATCHES:

You will need one match box drawer containing 20 matches, one empty match box drawer and a stopwatch or watch with
second hand.

Sit the child at a table with the two match boxes at a comfortable distance in front of him/her and 12 inches apart.

Ask the child to take the matches one at a time from the full drawer and transfer them to the empty drawer. One
hand only to be used — the other hand may be used to steady either box.

Say ‘Here is a box of matches. | want you to pick up the matches one at a time from the box and place them in the
other box like this. Do it as quickly as you can’.

Time how long it takes for the child to transfer the matches from one box to the other. Repeat the test with the other

 

hand.

B30. FIGURE DRAWING ON PALM OF HAND: (GRAPHESTHESIA) xX O 3
You will need a blunt point. for example a biro with tip retracted.

 

 

 

Ask the child to place both his/her hands on a table, palms uppermost. Using the blunt point, firmly describe a
figure 8 on the child's right palm. Take two seconds to draw it. and allow the child to watch. Ask him/her what you
have drawn. Now draw a figure 8 on the left palm and again ask him/her what you have drawn.

Now please show the child the 4 figures depicted in the instruction booklet, and ask the child to name each one.
In case instruction booklet is not available the 4 figures are reproduced above.

Ask child to close his/her eyes. Draw the first figure indicated in the following list on the right palm and ask the
child what it was. Record whether child correct, incorrect or uncertain. Continue drawing the figures on the palm
indicated and record the results. Praise the child for the first correct response. Please do not repeat any part of the
test.

If the child is non-verbal. ask him/her to point to the correct shape rather than name it.

Please make sure the child has no shoes on.

Ask the child to stand on his/her right leg with the left foot against the knee of the right leg, hands on hips. Give
him/her a moment to settle, then tell the child to try to keep the position for 30 seconds.

Watch the position of hands and feet and record how soon the hands move from the hips or the feet move.

WALKING BACKWARDS (20 STEPS) Piease make sure child has no shoes on.

Find a straight line on the fioor at least 4 metres long, e.g. the edge of a floorboard, or mark one out with chalk. Use
a corridor if the examination room is not long enough.

Ask the child to put his/her hands on hips and then to walk backwards along the line, placing one foot behind the
other, toe-to-heel.

The examiner should first demonstrate the test, saying ‘I want you to walk like this. Remember your toes must
touch your heel with each step you take. Keep your hands on your hips. Walk backwards in a straight line. You may
glance behind you if it helps’.

Let the child have two practices by asking him/her to walk backwards for 5 steps on each occasion.

Then ask the child to walk backwards for 20 steps. Count the number of steps the child makes before making an
error. An error occurs if he/she ceases to maintain toe-to-heel or deviates from the line or moves either hand from
hips. If the child makes an error in the first 5 steps, continue to count the number of steps until the next error.
