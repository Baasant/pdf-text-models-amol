WOMEN’S HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE YEARS

 

 

 

Postal Questionnaire 2003

This short postal questionnaire is for everyone and we would appreciate you taking a few minutes to complete it.
In order to continue our research on health and the menopause it is important that all women complete this
questionnaire whether or not they have reached menopause or used hormone replacement therapy (HRT). When
we last contacted women study members, one in eight were still perimenopausal and one in twenty remained
premenopausal. In addition, many will have taken hormone replacement therapy since the last questionnaire and
some will have had an operation to remove the uterus or ovaries. Thus this questionnaire updates menstrual,
surgical and HRT histories. If there is little or nothing to report this will involve only a few questions but we
still need to have the information to conduct our research.

We are delighted that so many women in the study complete the postal questionnaires. This has allowed us to
publish widely on health topics of importance to women at midlife, including lifetime influences on timing of
perimenopause and menopause, common symptoms and health care, breast cancer, and body dissatisfaction.
Recent work is summarised on the birthday card and in our list of new publications. We are now incorporating
this information on the menopause into our studies of earlier biological risk and lifetime social circumstances in
relation to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and other measures of function.

When completing the questionnaire please use a pen to circle the appropriate response to each question and
provide further details where requested. Please feel free to add any further explanations or comments that will
help us to understand your particular experiences.

All information you give us will be treated in the strictest confidence. If you have any queries please do not
hesitate to telephone Diana Kuh or Rebecca Hardy on 020 7679 1720 or write to us at the above address.

When you have finished filling in the questionnaire please use the pre-paid envelope provided to post it back to
us. Thank you very much for your time and cooperation.

Please give the date you completed this questionnaire: day month 20 year
