Q U E S T I O N N A I R E

This questionnaire asks about your daughter now sh e is a toddler. We are
interested to know about her health and behaviour and how she gets on
with other children. Your answers will help us to understand the
problems that toddlers and their parents have.

It is like the other questionnaires you have received. To answer simply
tick the box which best describes your toddler or your toddler's
situation. Again some questions will seem similar but they are not the
same. Please answer all questions that you can. If you cannot answer any
questions or if they do not apply to you please put a line through them.
There are no right or wrong answers. Please just describe what happens
in your situation. You may make additional comments at the end. All
answers are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
