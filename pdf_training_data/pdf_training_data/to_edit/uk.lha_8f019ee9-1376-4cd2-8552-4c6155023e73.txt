FUTURE CONSENT FORM 
 

Ask the participant if they would be willing to complete the future consent form

Put your finger on this key marked ‘0’ and look at the screen.  This is the only key you will 

need to use.  Every time you see a ‘0’ or an ‘8’ on the screen press the key once as quickly as 

you can.  We will start with a practice run to make sure you know what to do.  Are you clear 

about it?  I am going to start the machine now, so look for the ‘0’s or ‘8’s and press firmly as 

soon as you see one. 

 

Press start button.  Correct any error during 8 practice trials. When the ‘wait’ indicator 

appears, say:

I’m now going to give you a slightly harder test.  This time the numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 will 

appear on the screen.  I want you to press the key that has the same number as that on the 

screen.  If you see a ‘4’ on the screen, press key 4 as quickly as possible.  If you see a ‘1’, 

press key 1, and so on. 

 

Use both hands to do this.  Put the 1
st
 and 2

nd
 fingers of each hand on the four keys (1, 2, 3, 4).  

(Other fingers can be used if necessary.) 

 

If the participant has a non-functional hand, tick here                and go to the next test.          

 

I am going to start the machine again.  Remember to press the same number as the number on 

the screen.  This is another practice run.

short periods if you need to. You will be given instructions to take away with you and a box 

and pre-paid label for posting it back to us. If you want, we can send you information about 

your results.

and give participant full instructions as in nurse manual. 
 

O.     COLLECTION OF SALIVARY CORTISOL AT HOME

 “Here are the instructions for collecting these samples. We are asking you to collect one 

sample between 9.00-9.30p.m this evening, a second sample as soon as you wake up tomorrow 

morning, and a third sample 30 minutes after waking up. Each time you will need to write 

down on this form the actual time the sample was taken and report any stress, anxiety or trauma 

that occurred in the hour before the sample was taken. Then we would like you to place each 

salivette tube in to the transport container and place them in this pre-paid jiffy bag, and post the 

bag back to the lab. Thank you very much for taking the time to do this.” [If participant has a 

visit on a Friday, please ask them to take the first sample on Sunday night and the other two 

samples on Monday morning and then post them back to the lab]
