EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR THE MEMBER OF STAFF COMPLETING THIS FORM

This pupil or student was enrolled at birth in a National Survey of Health and Development. With the
help of his parents and of health visitors, school teachers and nurses, a detailed account has been obtained
of his health and development during the past 18 years. The Survey pupils and students come from all types
of home, and are attending, or have attended all types of school and college, both local authority and independ-
ent: a great number are of course already in employment. Only 2% of those who were at school in England,
Wales and Scotland have been lost, andthe value of this enquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information
for every possible Survey member: the fewer the losses the more valuable is the information received.

We are particularly interested in the group that was still at school or college last autumn and hope that
you will be able to give us information about the above-named pupil’s or student’s examination record,
leaving date and present whereabouts. Those entering higher education willbe part of a special study over the
next year of so.

Please return this questionnaire to your Education Authority by the end of November.
