This questionnaire asks about how you have been since the birth of the
baby. It asks how you are feeling, whether you are getting enough sleep
and how you reacted to the actual birth.

All the answers you give are confidential. Your name and address will
not be on the questionnaire.

We would be grateful if you would help us by answering as many of these
questions as possible but if there is any question you do not want to
answer that is fine. Just leave it blank.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP
