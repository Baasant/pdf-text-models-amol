Babies grow so quickly, and change so much. This questionnaire asks
about any accidents or problems he may have had, what he has been
eating and drinking, his temperament and the way he may be beginning
to understand the world about him.

It is like the other questionnaires you have received. To answer simply
tick the box which best describes your son or your son's situation.
Again some questions will seem similar but they are not the same.
Please answer all questions that you can. If you cannot answer any
questions or if they do not apply to you please put a line through
them. There are no right or wrong answers. Please just describe what
happens in your situation. You may make additional comments at the
end. All answers are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
