NATIONAL SURVEY OF THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN

79 Wimpole Street, London, W.1.

Under the joint auspices of

Institute of Child Health (University of London); Society National Foundation for Educational Research in
of Medical Officers of Health; Population Investigation England and Wales.
Committee.

The Scottish Council for Research in Education.

QUESTIONNAIRE FOR HEADMASTERS AND HEADMISTRESSES OF SCHOOLS
ATTENDED BY SURVEY CHILDREN

EXPLANATORY NOTE

The children enrolled in this Survey were born in March 1946 and with the help of their parents, health visitors,
school nurses and teachers a detailed account has been obtained of their health and development during the past 15
years. The children come from all types of home and are attending all types of school, both Independent and Local
Authority. They are now reaching the age when many of them will be leaving school and the Joint Committee feels
some uniform assessment of their progress together with background information about the secondary schools they have
been attending is most desirable. During the past 15 years only 10 per cent of the children have been lost and the
value of this inquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child.

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM

There may be more than one survey child in your school, but since this form contains only general questions
relating to the school it will only be necessary for you to fill in one of these forms (S.8b). But it is essential that you
enter on this form the full names and reference numbers of all the survey children concerned. These will be found
on the accompanying test booklets (Forms N.F.4) and should be copied from there. When you have filled in this form
please return it, together with the test booklets (Forms N.F.4) and Teacher’s Questionnaires (Forms S. 8a), to the
Director of Education.

All information given will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility that the name of any child
or school will appear in any report.
