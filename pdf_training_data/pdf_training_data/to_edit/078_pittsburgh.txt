Scoring the PSQI 
 

The order of the PSQI items has been modified from the original order in order to 
fit the first 9 items (which are the only items that contribute to the total score) on a single 
page. Item 10, which is the second page of the scale, does not contribute to the PSQI 
score.  
 
 In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no 
difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global 
score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. 
 
Component 1: Subjective sleep quality—question 9 

Response to Q9  Component 1 score 
Very good    0 
Fairly good   1 
Fairly bad    2 
Very bad    3 

        Component 1 score:_____ 
Component 2: Sleep latency—questions 2 and 5a 

Response to Q2  Component 2/Q2 subscore 
< 15 minutes   0 
16-30 minutes   1 
31-60 minutes   2 
> 60 minutes   3 
 
Response to Q5a  Component 2/Q5a subscore 
Not during past month  0 
Less than once a week  1 
Once or twice a week  2

Response to Q4  Component 3 score

6-7 hours    1 
5-6 hours    2 
< 5 hours    3 

        Component 3 score:_____ 
Component 4: Sleep efficiency—questions 1, 3, and 4 

 Sleep efficiency = (# hours slept/# hours in bed) X 100% 
   # hours slept—question 4 
   # hours in bed—calculated from responses to questions 1 and 3 

Sleep efficiency  Component 4 score 
> 85%    0
