The Institute of Education has commissioned the National Centre for Social Research
to conduct a survey about children’s lives in the 21st Century called Child of the
New Century.

The child named below is part of this study. This child’s parents have given us their
written permission to invite you to complete this teacher questionnaire.

All of the information you provide will be treated in strict confidence in accordance with
the Data Protection Act and will be used for research purposes only. None of the
information you provide will be passed on to the child or their parents.

Please answer the questions about the child named below. The questionnaire should
take 15-20 minutes to complete. If you require any assistance or have any questions
you can call the research team on 0800 783 5890.

How to answer the questions

To complete the questionnaire each question should be considered separately. For each question,
judgement should be made which represents your assessment of the child’s typical attainment, in the
sense that while a child’s behaviour may vary somewhat from day to day and from context to context, the
assessment made is the best description of the child’s achievement.

Please read each question carefully. Please tick yes or no if the child has achieved the competency.
All of the questions can be answered by ticking the box next to the answer that applies to the child.

Yes No

1. Shows an interest in classroom activities through observations or participation  

If you make a mistake, put a line through the wrong answer, and place a tick in the box next to the answer,
like this:

Yes No

1. Shows an interest in classroom activities through observations or participation         

You can miss out any question if you don’t want to answer, just leave the box blank.

About the Questionnaire

The questionnaire asks about the child’s ability in six different areas of learning. They are asked in order
to gain a snapshot of a child’s progress in this area of learning. Three of the areas are further broken down
into subgroups and have a separate assessment scales for each.

• Personal, social and emotional development (Disposition and attitudes; Social development;
Emotional development).

• Communication, language and literacy (Communication, language and literacy; linking sounds and
letters; reading and writing).

• Mathematical development (Numbers as labels and for counting; Calculating; Shape, space and
measures).

• Knowledge and understanding of the world.

• Physical development.

• Creative development.

Each of the 13 assessment scales has nine questions. Each question describes a competency.
You are asked to say whether or not the child has achieved this competency.

The first three questions describe a child who is at an early stage in their learning in this area.
Most children will have achieved all of these three competencies, but there may be some exceptions 
to this pattern.

The next five questions are presented in approximate order of difficulty. However, the competencies are
not necessarily hierarchical and a child may achieve a later competency without having achieved some or
all of the earlier ones.

The final question in each scale describes a child who has achieved all the competencies from 1–8 
on that scale, has developed further both in breadth and depth, and is working consistently beyond the
previous competencies.

For a small number of children with special educational needs, it may not be possible to make an
assessment.
