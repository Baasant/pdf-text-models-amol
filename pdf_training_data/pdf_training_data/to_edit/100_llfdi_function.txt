INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUNCTION QUESTIONS: 
 
In this following section, I will ask you about your ability to do specific activities as part of your 
daily routines.  I am interested in your sense of your ability to do it on a typical day.  It is not 
important that you actually do the activity on a daily basis.  In fact, I may mention some 
activities that you don’t do at all.  You can still answer these questions by assessing how difficult 
you think they would be for you to do on an average day.   
 
Factors that influence the level of difficulty you have may include: pain, fatigue, fear, weakness, 
soreness, ailments, health conditions, or disabilities.  
 
I want to know how difficult the activity would be for you to do without the help of someone 
else, and without the use of a cane, walker or any other assistive walking device (or wheelchair 
or scooter). 
 
 
Interviewer personal note:   
For the Function items, using fixed support is acceptable (e.g. holding onto furniture, walls), 
unless otherwise specified in the item.
