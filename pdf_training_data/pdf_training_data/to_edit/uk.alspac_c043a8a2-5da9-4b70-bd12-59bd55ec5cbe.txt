(F O R    P A R T N E R S)

This questionnaire is for the parent who is less involved in the day to day
care of your toddler. Usually this will be the father.  This
questionnaire asks about your lifestyle now that you have a toddler. Its
purpose is to find out the role partners have in bringing up a toddler and
any problems they might find. Your answers will help us to identify
problems which may be changed by alterations in the healthcare system.

It asks you a number of questions ab out yourself and about bringing up a
toddler. To answer you simply tick the box which is most accurate in your
opinion.

Please answer all questions if you can, even if some are similar to those you
may have answered before. If you cannot answer a question or if it does not
apply to you, put a line through it. There are no good or bad answers. Just
tell us what you think. All answers are confidential.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP
