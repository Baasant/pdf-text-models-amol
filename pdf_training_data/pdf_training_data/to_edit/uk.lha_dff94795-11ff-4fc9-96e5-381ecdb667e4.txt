EXPLANATORY NOTE

The student named above is a member of this national sample -of 5000 young people who have been followed up since
their birth in 1946, through the generous co-operation of Local Education Authorities, schools, the Youth Employment Service
and colleges. The present study is concerned with the vocational training and further or technical education of those members
of the sample who have left school. It is supported by a grant from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

We believe, either from a form completed by the college last year, or from information supplied by a Youth Employment
Officer, that this student attended your college in the session 1963/64. We should be most grateful if you would provide us
with information about the course and his performance EVEN IF HE DID NOT COMPLETE THE SESSION.

All information will be regarded as strictly confidential and there is no possibility of the name of the college, or of the
student, appearing in any report.

HOW TO FILL IN THIS FORM

We would ask that this form be completed by the Head of Department concerned. Where a question has several possible

answers, please circle the number opposite the appropriate reply. If you feel that further amplification of any reply is needed,
please do not hesitate to give it.

If the student did not enrol at this college in 1963/64 but you know he went on to another college, please insert the name
of the new college at the top of the form and return it to your Local Education Authority who will re-allocate it.

When the form is completed please return it to your Local Education Authority, to be forwarded to the National Survey
of Health and Development, M.R.C. Unit, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, W.C.2, by the end of
November, 1964.
