ST. GEORGE’S RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE
for COPD patients

(SGRQ-C)

This questionnaire is designed to help us learn much more about how your breathing is
troubling you and how it affects your life.
We are using it to find out which aspects of your illness cause you most problems, rather than
what the doctors and nurses think your problems are.

Please read the instructions carefully and ask if you do not understand anything. Do not
spend too long deciding about your answers.
