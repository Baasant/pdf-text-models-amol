SELF RATING QUESTIONNAIRES

THE TWO SELF RATING QUESTIONNAIRES ARE IN THE SEPARATE TEST BOOKLET WHICH SHOULD BE GIVEN TO
THE SURVEY MEMBER TO FILL IN HIMSELF

THE INTERVIEWER SHOULD PROVIDE A PENCIL AND SHOULD HAVE A WATCH WITH A SECOND HAND OR A STOP WATCH

FIRST QUESTIONNAIRE
ALL SURVEY MEMBERS

I should now like you to answer two questionnaires which you filled in about 10 years ago. The first consists of some questions regarding the way
you behave, feel and act. It is on the front page of the booklet I have just given you.

After each question there is a ‘“‘Yes’’, and ‘‘?”? (question mark) and a ‘‘No”’. Try and decide whether ‘“Yes’’ or No” represents your usual way of
acting or feeling; then put a circle round the “‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No”’. If you find it absolutely impossible to decide, put a circle round the ‘‘?”, but do not
use this answer except very occasionally. Work quickly, and don’t spend too much time oyer any question; we want your first reaction, not a long
drawn-out thought process. The whole questionnaire shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Be sure not to omit any questions. Now go ahead, work
quickly, and remember to answer every question. There are no right or wrong answers, and this isn’t a test of intelligence or ability, but simply a
measure of the way you behave.

(When the questionnaire is completed make sure that all questions have been answered. Then proceed to the reading test.)

mage,

SECOND QUESTIONNAIRE (READING TEST)
ALL SURVEY MEMBERS
THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY
I should now like you to do a test which you filled in once before when you were 15. Here it is—don’t start before I ask you to do so.
Two examples are given on page 1. Will you read the first? (Help the survey member if necessary)

(A bird lays its eggs in a pond, stream, cloud, house, nest). Which is right? Yes, “NEST” is the right word, so nest has a line underneath it. All
other words are wrong. Now read the next one.

(Bread is made from wood, flour, grass, stone, salt.) Which is right? Yes, ‘“FLOUR”’ is right, so a line has been put under it.

Do you see what to do? You go through the sentences on the following three pages and find the right word in each one, and then draw a line under it.
DON’T START YET.

You are not expected to do all the sentences. You only have 10 minutes so just do as many as you can. Notice that there are three pages (2, 3
and 4). When you have finished the first two pages check what you have done, and then, if you have time turn over to the third page and continue.

If you make a mistake and want to alter a line, just cross through the wrong line, with your pencil, and draw in the right one.

Do you understand? Right! Turn over to page 2. Begin.

NOTE THE EXACT TIME WHEN “BEGIN” WAS SAID AND ALSO WHAT THE TIME WILL BE 10 (TEN) MINUTES LATER
AT THE END OF EXACTLY 10 MINUTES, SAY:

Put down your pencil. This is the end of this test. REAT72

IF THE SURVEY MEMBER COMPLETED THE WHOLE TEST BEFORE THE TEN MINUTES ARE UP ENTER THE TIME TAKEN
