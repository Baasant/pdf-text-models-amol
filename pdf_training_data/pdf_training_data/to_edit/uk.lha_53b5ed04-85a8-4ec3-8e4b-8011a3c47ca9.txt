IF THE FAMILY HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY PLEASE ENTER THE NEW ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF
THE NEW L.E.A. AND NEW SCHOOL IN THE SPACE PROVIDED. IF THE CHILD CANNOT BE TRACED PLEASE ENTER
THE LAST ADDRESS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US TO TRACE HIM. IN EITHER CASE
RETURN THE FORM TO WHOMEVER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER TO RECEIVE IT.

Approach to the Mother

Remind her that in 1946, 1948 and 1950 she gave us most valuable information about herself and her child. We now want to find out what
progress her child has made during the last two years. All information she gives will, of course, be ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL.

Purpose of this inquiry

This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of
Medical Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. Details of health and development have been recorded at two yearly intervals
during the pre-school years and it is hoped that, during the primary school period, a clinical examination will be made by the School Doctor each year and
a record of illnesses made each term by the School Nurse. The aim of the present examination is to bring the medical and social history up to date, to
check information previously noted, and to record the clinical state of the child. This will complete our information for the whole of the pre-school period.

The children in this sample are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in March 1946. They are drawn from all social
classes and during the first six years of their lives only 5% of the original sample have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information being
obtained for every possible survey child. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

This form refers to the past medical history and to the home and family background of the child. A clinical examination form is being completed
by the School Doctor. When following the future progress of this child a very much briefer record card will be used.
How to fill in this form.

Six thousand Mothers scattered all over the country, are being interviewed, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of Health
Visitors and School Nurses who are seeing them should record their findings ina comparable way. For this reason, and also to reduce the amount of
clerical work, this form has been framed asa series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several printed alternatives. All that is
required is to put a circle round the number opposite the printed answer thatimost nearly describes your findings. If no alternative fits please write the
answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain your findings,
we should be most grateful for any further information you can give us. When a question does not apply it should be struck through. When either you
or the Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact should be recorded in the space directly under the question.

In order to ensure that this information is obtained in the same way by the many people taking part in the survey, it is important that the wording
and order of this form should be adhered to.

COMPLETED FORMS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER AND NOT DIRECTLY TO
THE JOINT COMMITTEE
THIS INQUIRY REFERS THROUGHOUT TO THE CHILD BORN IN MARCH 1946, RING WITH A SOFT PENCIL THE CODE
NUMBER OPPOSITE THE MOTHER’S ANSWER. IF NO ANSWER IS GIVEN RECORD THIS FACT UNDER THE QUESTION.
IF A QUESTION DOES NOT APPLY, STRIKE IT THROUGH.
