Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) – Instructions for Use 

 

The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire is designed for use in adults, i.e. patients 
over the age of 16.  It is self-explanatory and can be simply handed to the patient who is asked 
to fill it in without the need for detailed explanation.  It is usually completed in one to two 
minutes.  

SCORING 

The scoring of each question is as follows: 
Very much      scored 3 
A lot       scored 2 
A little      scored 1 
Not at all      scored 0 
Not relevant      scored 0 
Question 7, “prevented work or studying” scored 3 
 
The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30.  The 
higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.

6 – 10  moderate effect on patient’s life
