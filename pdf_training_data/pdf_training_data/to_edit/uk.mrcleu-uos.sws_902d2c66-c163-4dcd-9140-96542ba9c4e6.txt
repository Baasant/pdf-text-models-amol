2: ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE 
 Now I’m going to ask you about your activity and exercise patterns over the last three 

months.  We would like you to divide up a “typical” day into three types of activity. 

These are: 

  (1) sleeping or lying,   (2) sitting, (3) standing or walking. 

 

 

2.1 Over a typical 24 hour day how many hours do you 

 generally spend sleeping or lying with your feet up?                 hrs       mins    

  

 (ask time usually go to bed & wake up, including any at work!) 

 

 This would indicate xx hours sitting or on your feet. 

 

 

2.2 Of those hours how many on a typical day do you spend sitting  

down?  (e.g. includes sitting at work, mealtimes, 

 driving, reading, watching TV)                                                                               

                        hrs      mins 

 

                                                                                               

2.3 This would mean that you spend about xx hours a day on your feet.  Does this sound 

about right? 

                                                                                                                    hrs                mins

2.4 Out of these xx hours spent on your feet, about how much of the time are you actively  

 on the move (rather than standing fairly still)? 

*  1. Very little 10% 

  2. Some  30% 

  3. About half 50% 

  4. Most  70%

 * exercise or activities?

 and on average about how long does                 

 each period of activity last?            hrs            mins

3:  DIETARY QUESTIONS 
 

3.1 Now I am going to ask you about the foods you eat. To do this I have a list of foods and I would like you to tell me how often you have eaten each food 

during the past 3 months.  The list may include foods you never eat or you may find foods which you eat a lot are missing.  These can be added on at the 

end. (Define the 3 month period)
