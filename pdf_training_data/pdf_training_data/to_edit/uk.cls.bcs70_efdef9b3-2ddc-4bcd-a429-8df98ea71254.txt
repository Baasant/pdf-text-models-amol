Notes for Completion of Schedule

1. Aims

The purpose of this Schedule is to obtain data on the utilisation by the study child of child heaith
clinics, health visiting facilities, developmental screening tests and other important aspects of the com-
munity health services. As parental recall of past events is often incomplete, reference to pre-school
child health records is also essential as a means.of confirming and supplementing information obtained
by the Health Visitor in the home interview.

2. Person(s) Completing Schedule

Ideally the Health Visitor who is carrying out the home interview should also complete this schedule.
Some of the information may require access to records usually held centrally, such as in Area or
District Offices or in Health Boards (Scotland), e.g. special handicap records, centrally held registers.
The personnel used and arrangements made for completion will doubtless be decided by the Area or
District officer responsible according to local contingency.

3. Records Required
(a) The following basic types of records are essential for the main part of this schedule.

(i) Records used by health visitor to record health visiting, e.g. Home Visiting records, Consultation
Record Cards and, where available, Family Records. These will be referred to as H.V. records,

(ii) Records used in Child Health Clinics or Child Welfare Clinics by doctors to record developmental
screening and other health care, e.g. MCW 46. These will be referred to as C.H.C. records.

(b)Some questions require reference to other sources, in addition to the above basic records — for
children for whom there may be letters or reports indicating past hospital outpatient attendances or
inpatient care, children who are on observation or other registers, children who have been assessed
for special educational treatment and other children who have handicaps or disabilities. In some
instances, this information will be available in H.V.’s or C.H.C. records, but arrangements will prob-
ably be necessary for this to be supplemented from records or information held centrally.

(c) Records about developmental screening are needed for question 4. The majority of general develop-
mental check-ups and specific screening tests will be recorded on records used by doctors in Child
Health Clinics and on H.V. records. Additional information about any developmental check-ups at
G.P. practices or health centres would be valuable, and may be readily available to health visitors
attached to G.P. practices. Developmental check-ups are sometimes carried out elsewhere, e.g. at
hospital birth follow-up clinics, and vision and hearing are often screened duting routine medical
examination at day nursery, nursery and infant school. This information would be appreciated if it
is readily available.




4. Developmental Screening & Assessment

5.

Developmental screening in 0.4 refers to check-ups usually routinely performed on all pre-school
children to identify those who may be developmentally delayed or have a suspected vision or hearing
defect.

Developmental assessment in 0.5 refers to a much more detailed examination of development, which
is usually only performed on children who have already been identified as having a possible delay or
defect in hearing, vision or other aspect of development.

What to include as Developmental Screening in Q.4 Part |

(a) Any record of a routine general developmental examination or a check-up of overall developmental
progress.
This term does not refer to an isolated single screening test, though specific screening tests may often
be included in the genera! observations and examination made of the child’s developmental achieve-
ments. General developmental examinations or check-ups of overall developmental progress are
usually carried out at or near prescribed ages in C.H.C., home or G.P.’s practices by dottor or health
visitor. The result is often entered on C.H.C. or H.V. records under several headings of ‘develop-
mental’ function e.g. hearing and language, posture and locomotion, vision, social behaviour, or may
be entered in the form of observations of individual developmental achievements of the child, e.g.
sitting, smiling, saying single words, etc. If neither of these forms of recording are present in the
notes, but it is definitely indicated that a general developmental check-up was made, this should be
included, Please include also any record you may have of a general medical examination or check-up
carried out by a doctor at nursery or infant school.

(b)Any record of*tests for vision, hearing or squint.

Vision and hearing may be tested on their own or as part of a general developmental examination or
check-up of overall developmental progress. They are routine clinical procedures used for testing
these specia! functions, e.g. routine testing of hearing by rattle, paper etc. by H.V. at 7—9 months,
screening of vision by Stycar 5-letter test at age 3 years. If the details of the type of test used are not
clear but the records indicate that vision, hearing or both have been checked, such entries should. be
included as vision or hearing tests.

Any record that there has been a check-up for a squint should be entered separately as ‘examination
for squint’ and not be entered as a vision test in section b of the table in 0.4. Include as “examina-
tion for squint” any occasion where records indicate a specific test was made, e.g. cover test or light
reflection test, or where the records indicate only if a squint was, or was not, evident in the course
of a general examination. Records of any such test(s) for vision, hearing or squint carried out at
nursery or infant school should also be included.

(c) Please exclude from Q.4 Part | any remarks or observations of developmental progress made at times
other than the developmental screening examinations and tests described above. Details of these
should be entered in Q.4 Part II.

General Notes
(a) Every question should be answered.

(b)Please base your answers only on information which is contained in the record form(s), registers
etc. There is space provided below each question for you to add any information known to you
from other sources.

(c) If you have any difficulty in interpreting or reading the relevant entry on records, ring code marked
“records unclear’ and give details in the space for “comments” at the end of the question.

(d)}If you do not have the relevant record(s) at ali when answering a question, please ring code marked
“‘No records”.

(e) Allowance shculd be made for the fact that the fermat of every question inevitably cannot corres:
pond with all the different recording systems in use throughout the country. Space is therefore
provided at the end of each question for comments, and for supplying extra data such as:

(i) | additional information known to you but not on the records;
(ii) details of any difficulties with obtaining or interpreting the data on the relevant record;

(iii) other observations, e.g. where the information given on records is considered not to reflect a
true picture of the actual events.

(f) Some abbreviations are used in this schedule, e.g.

4. Part!
Please complete table below for each occasion N received developmental screening (exclude P.K.U./hip tests) — either a
general developmental examination or check-up or a screening test of hearing, vision or squint, (see notes on page 2).
The following examples illustrate what is required (see table below). .
Example A. If it was noted on the H.V.’s record that on 15th November 1970, the H.V. carried out a routine test of
hearing at N’s home, the entry should be as in Example A.
Example B. If on 8th January 1971 it was recorded by the doctor at the C.H.C. at a nine-month developmental examina-
tion that the child had turned right and left to the sound of rattle, paper, spoken voice, had visually followed rolling balls
and that his general development was tested, with normal co-ordination, motor and social development, the entry should
be as in Example B.
Note that only the fact that N was tested is to be entered in the answer to this question; details of any referral for assess-
ment or for further investigations for suspected delay or abnormality should be recorded in Q.5.
Notes for completion of section (b) in table below.
Whenever records indicate that a routine general developmental check-up or examination was made, ring 1. If a hearing
test, a vision test and/or an examination for squint was included as part of this general developmental check-up, ring 2, 3
and/or 4 as appropriate. If a comprehensive developmental scale, e.g. Denver or Griffiths, was used, ring 1, 2 and 3 even
though individual components may not be specified; please name any such scale used in “‘“comments’’ below the table.
Ring 2, 3 and/or 4 in section (b) if screening for hearing, vision and/or squint was done on occasion(s) separate from a
general developmental check-up. i
In answering section (c) below, give the main person responsible if more than one person carried out tests or made
observations on any one occasion.
