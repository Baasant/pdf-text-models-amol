EXPLANATORY NOTE

You will no doubt remember completing previous forms for this study:
much valuable information has been gained as a result of these. We are
asking you now to complete this questionnaire, so that we may get a full
picture of what you are doing at the present time.

Please answer every question: some questions have numbered answers,
with these questions all that is necessary for you is to put a ring round

the number of the answer that is right for you. Other questions require
you to write two or three words.

Thank you very much for your co-operation both now and in the past.
