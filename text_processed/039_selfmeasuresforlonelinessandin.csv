Description of Measure:,0
,0
A 20-item scale designed to measure one’s subjective feelings of loneliness as well as,0
"feelings of social isolation.  Participants rate each item as either O (“I often feel this way”),",0
"S (“I sometimes feel this way”), R (“I rarely feel this way”), N (“I never feel this way”).",0
The measure has been revised two times since its first publication; once to create,0
"reverse scored items, and once to simplify the wording.  (See other UCLA Loneliness Scale",0
pages on the site).,0

The development of an adequate assessment instrument is a necessary prerequisite for,0
social psychological research on loneliness. Two studies provide methodological,0
refinement in the measurement of loneliness. Study 1 presents a revised version of the,0
"self-report UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale, designed to",0
"counter the possible effects of response bias in the original scale, and reports concurrent",0
validity evidence for the revised measure. Study 2 demonstrates that although,0
"loneliness is correlated with measures of negative affect, social risk taking, and",0
"affiliative tendencies, it is nonetheless a distinct psychological experience.",0

In this article I evaluated the psychometric properties of the UCLA Loneliness Scale,0
"(Version 3). Using data from prior studies of college students: nurses, teachers, and the",0
"elderly, analyses of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of this new version of",0
the UCLA Loneliness Scale were conducted. Results indicated that the measure was,0
"highly reliable, both in terms of internal consistency (coefficient a ranging from .89 to",0
.94) and test-retest reliability over a 1-year period (r = .73). Convergent validity for the,0
scale was indicated by significant correlations with other measures of loneliness.,0
Construct validity was supported by significant relations with measures of the adequacy,0
"of the individual's interpersonal relationships, and by correlations between loneliness",0
and measures of health and well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a,0
model incorporating a global bipolar loneliness factor along with two method factors,0
reflecting direction of item wording provided a very good fit to the data across samples.,0
Implications of these results for future measurement research on loneliness are,0
discussed.,0

Research on loneliness has been hampered by its strong association with depression.,0
"The 2 states frequently co-occur, and measures of the 2 states are substantially",0
correlated. Inability to manipulate experimentally loneliness or depression makes it,0
difficult to untangle the causal influence of one on the other. The combination of,0
longitudinal design and structural equation methodology is proposed as a solution to,0
"this general problem. Measures of loneliness and depression (e.g., the Beck Depression",0
Inventory and Profile of Mood States) were administered to undergraduates at 2 points,0
5 wks apart. Data from 333 Ss were correlated and analyzed under a succession of,0
structural equation models. Results indicate that loneliness and depression were,0
"correlated but clearly different constructs; neither was a direct cause of the other,",0
although both probably share some common origins; both were highly stable over the 5-,0
wk period.,0
