INTERPRETING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY,0

questions by counting the number to the right of each question you marked. The highest possible,0
total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all,0
"twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest",0
possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you circles zero on each question.,0
