We’d like you to answer some questions about different things in your life. You can stop at,0
any time. It is not a test so there are no right or wrong answers. If you don’t want to answer,0
"a question that’s ok, you can skip it.  If you wish to go back and change an answer that",0
"you’ve given, click ‘Back’.  It usually takes about 15 minutes. Some of the questions are",0
about things that are personal so please make sure you fill in the questionnaire on your,0
own. We’d like to remind you that all the answers you give will be completely confidential.,0
We hope that you find the questions interesting and enjoy answering them.,0

Some questions are about things that are more personal. Remember no-one in your family,0
will see your answers. If you come to a question that you don’t want to answer that’s ok.,0
You can skip it and move to the next one by pressing ‘next’.,0
,0
Some questions are about things that not all young people your age will have done. That’s,0
ok – we’re just as interested in what people haven’t done as well as what they have. It’s,0
important that you answer honestly.,0
