"Based upon the results from recent studies (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000; Evans &",0

"Rothbart, 2007) we have formulated a self-report model of temperament that includes",0
,0
"general constructs of effortful control, negative affect (which can be further divided into",0
,0
"aggressive and nonaggressive negative affects) extraversion/surgency, orienting",0

"sensitivity, and affiliativeness.",0
