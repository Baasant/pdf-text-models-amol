What is data linkage?,1
,0
Data linkage refers to the bringing together of information from more than one source that relates to the same,0
"person. This allows researchers to tell a bigger story than analysing data from just one source. For example,",0
comparing the data on women who received the HPV vaccination with data on women who developed cervical,0
"cancer provided strong evidence that overall, the vaccination was effective in reducing cervical cancer.",0
