This article describes the development and validation of a measure of the stress experienced,0
by African Americans as a result of their daily encounters with racism and discrimination.,0
The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is a 46-item instrument developed according to the,0
"theoretical framework of daily hassles (R. S. Lazarus & S. Folkman, 1984) and integrated",0
with P. Essed's (1990) concept of everyday racism. The IRRS has adequate indexes of,0
internal consistency and fair-to-adequate estimates of test-retest stability. Several subscales,0
of the IRRS and a global racism index were correlated with other measures of stress and,0
"racism. Furthermore, the IRRS discriminated between Blacks and non-Blacks in a group-",0
differences study. Both principal-components and confirmatory factor analyses supported a,0
4-component model of race-related stress.,0
,0
Racism and acts of discrimination against African Amer-,0
"icans have taken on various forms over the past 350 years,",0
"ranging from lynchings, burnings, beatings, and other forms",0
of direct violence to more subtle slights and innuendoes,0
"(Duckitt, 1992; Ponterotto & Pederson, 1993; Thompson,",0
"Neville, Weathers, Poston, & Atkinson, 1990). There have",0
been several scholarly works of historical significance ex-,0
amining the nature of racism and discrimination in relation,0
to the experiences of African Americans in the United,0
"States (e.g., Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Duc-",0
"kitt, 1992; Essed, 1990; Myrdal, 1944; Jones, 1972; Petti-",0
"grew, 1964; Simpson & Yinger, 1985). For the most part,",0
racism has been of interest primarily to social psychologists,0
who study the development and expression of prejudice and,0
"in-group/out-group attitudes, or sociologists who are pri-",0
marily concerned with the outcome effects of racism and,0
discrimination on groups of people within society. How-,0
"ever, psychologists have more recently begun to examine",0
the clinical significance of racism and its relationship to the,0
psychological well-being of African Americans who expe-,0
"rience it as a chronic stressor in their daily lives (see Burke,",0
"1984; Fernando, 1984; Jackson, Williams, & Torres, 1995;",0
"McNeilly et al., in press; Smith, 1985; White & Parham,",0
1990).,0
,0
Despite some perceived progress made in U.S. race rela-,0
"tions over the last three decades, many writers believe that",0
"for African Americans, racism continues to be an inescap-",0
"able and painful reality of daily life (Essed, 1990; Feagin &",0

"Sikes, 1994; McNeilly et al., in press). Essed (1990), in her",0
groundbreaking qualitative study of the daily experiences of,0
"Blacks with racism, described the chronic nature of the",0
"stress associated with racism this way: ""to live with the",0
"threat of racism means planning, almost everyday of one's",0
"life, how to avoid or defend oneself against discrimination""",0
(p. 260). The experience of racism for African Americans is,0
"cumulative, whereby new encounters are interpreted on the",0
"basis of past experiences with racism, knowledge of others'",0
"experience with racism, and knowledge about the systemic",0
"nature of racism (Essed, 1990; Feagin & Sikes, 1994).",0
,0
According to Dovidio and Gaetner (1986) racism is em-,0
"bedded in the ""social norms, institutional policies, and cog-",0
"nitive and affective systems of White Americans"" (p. xi)",0
and as a result has a significant adverse impact on the,0
quality of life for African Americans. Racism can occur in,0
"three spheres: (a) individual racism, experienced on a per-",0
"sonal level; (b) institutional racism, experienced as a result",0
of racism being embedded in the policies of a given insti-,0
"tution; and (c) cultural racism, results from the cultural",0
practices of one group being lauded as superior to those of,0
"another (Essed, 1990; Jones, 1972). Essed (1990) extended",0
the individual realm of racism to include collective racism.,0
Collective racism occurs when organized (or semiorga-,0
nized) Whites/non-Blacks seek to restrict the rights of,0
"Blacks (e.g., when a Black family moves into a White",0
community and is met with open hostility by its new neigh-,0
"bors). Because of the omnipresence of racism, it makes",0
intuitive sense that any effort to study its impact on African,0
Americans would focus on the multidimensional character,0
of its expression and experience.,0
,0
"Due to the insidiousness of everyday racism, empirical",0
examination of this construct can be an arduous task. Con-,0
"sequently, past research has generally focused on examining",0
the most overt acts of racism experienced by African Amer-,0
"icans. However, the racism experienced by African Amer-",0
"icans throughout the day—whether at work, in public",0
"places, in route to and from their homes, or on television",0
and other popular media outlets—for the most part has,0
"remained unexamined (Essed, 1990). The greatest challenge",0

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 491,0

faced by researchers who wish to measure the stressful,0
effects of everyday racism is to first identify it. The diffi-,0
culty of this task is exacerbated by the fact that everyday,0
"racism is often covert and can be subtle, elusive, or seem-",0
ingly intangible to those who experience it in their daily,0
"lives (Dovidio, 1993; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Essed,",0
1990).,0
,0
The stress associated with the experience of discrimina-,0
tion has been implicated in the development of psychiatric,0
"disorders such as depression (Burke, 1984), antisocial be-",0
"havior (Simpson & Yinger, 1985), lowered self-esteem",0
"(Fernando, 1984), lowered levels of general happiness and",0
"life satisfaction (Jackson et al., 1995), and poor academic",0
"performance (Gougis, 1986). The deleterious effect on the",0
psychological health of African Americans that may result,0
from everyday racism is significant and should be addressed,0
by counseling psychologists and other mental health prac-,0
titioners. When providing psychological services to African,0
"American clients, counselors can include an assessment,",0
"possibly during the intake process, of the extent to which",0
racism and discrimination might be related to the client's,0
"presenting problem or problems, or in some way interfering",0
"with the client's current level of functioning (Smith, 1985).",0
"Consequently, there is a strong need for a self-administered,",0
psychometrically sound (and relatively brief) measure of the,0
magnitude and range of an individual's experiences with,0
"racism and discrimination (Outlaw, 1993).",0
,0
Previous attempts to quantitatively examine the experi-,0
ences of African Americans with racism have resulted in the,0
development of several paper-and-pencil self-report instru-,0
"ments, none of which have been published in the major",0
psychological journals. These efforts have been aimed at,0
"examining the cognitive processes, emotional responses,",0
and the behavioral reactions associated with the experience,0
of racism and discrimination as reported by African Amer-,0
icans. The measures of racism currently available include,0
"the Racial Discrimination Index (RDI; Terrell & Miller,",0
"1980), the Racism Reaction Scale (RRS; Thompson et al.,",0
"1990), the Perceived Racism Scale (PRS; McNeilly et al., in",0
"press), and the Racism and Life Experience Scales—Brief",0
"Version (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994). In spite of several the-",0
"oretical and methodological limitations, these attempts to",0
quantify the experiences of African Americans with racism,0
and discrimination have made a substantial contribution to,0
the empirical examination of the stressful effects of racism.,0
,0
A psychometrically sound self-report instrument that,0
measures the stress associated with daily encounters of,0
racism and discrimination experienced by African Ameri-,0
"cans is needed. Such an instrument, if used in a clinical",0
"setting, would allow for the effective and efficient assess-",0
ment of the experience of race-related stress and its impact,0
on the psychological functioning of an individual. Having a,0
valid and reliable self-report measure available to determine,0
the extent to which racism adversely affects an individual's,0
psychological well-being would aid in the diagnosis and,0
treatment of some psychological and somatic stress-related,0
disorders prevalent in the African American community.,0
"Furthermore, a measure of race-related stress would have",0
"implications as a research tool, which would effectively",0
,0
allow for an examination of the relationship between racism,0
and some of the stress-induced psychological and somatic,0
health problems of African Americans. Other possibilities,0
for research inquiry include the relationship between the,0
stressful experience of racism and discrimination and racial-,0
identity development among African Americans. One could,0
also examine the relationship between the stressful effects,0
of racism and the impact of the counselor's willingness to,0
address these issues on counseling outcomes for African,0
Americans.,0
,0
The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is intended to,0
provide a much needed measure of the stress associated,0
with the experiences of racism and discrimination encoun-,0
tered by African Americans in their daily lives. The theo-,0
retical framework of the IRRS is grounded in the daily,0
hassles conceptualization of life stress proposed by Lazarus,0
and Folkman (1984) and integrated with Essed's (1990),0
concept of everyday racism. The IRRS samples the occur-,0
rence and perceived magnitude of stressful race-related,0
events occurring daily in the lives of African Americans.,0
The ERRS also takes into account the stressful effects of,0
"network events, which are stressful events that happen to",0
family members and people one cares about (Feagin &,0
"Sikes, 1994; Thoits, 1991). According to Lazarus and Folk-",0
"man (1984), ""it is perfectly appropriate to measure stress as",0
"either input, response, or strained relationship"" (p. 307).",0
"Furthermore, they posit that stress can be envisioned as a",0
"general concept much like emotion, motivation, or cogni-",0
"tion, but operationalized according to the perceived magni-",0
tude of the interactions with the environment that tax or,0
"exceed the person's resources. Accordingly, the IRRS mea-",0
sures race-related stress operationalized as the occurrence,0
and perceived magnitude of specific events of racism and,0
discrimination that African Americans potentially experi-,0
ence in their daily lives.,0
,0
In the development of the IRRS as a measure of race-,1
"related stress, the researchers sought to answer several sig-",1
"nificant and related questions. First, is the experience of",1
racism that African Americans encounter in their daily lives,1
a multidimensional phenomenon that occurs across domains,1
"(i.e., institutionally, culturally, etc.)? Second, would the",1
"IRRS correlate with other measures of stress and racism,",1
thereby proving itself to be a valid measure of race-related,1
"stress within its own right? Furthermore, could the IRRS be",1
proven as a reliable measure of race-related stress on the,1
basis of indexes of internal consistency and stability over,1
"time? Finally, because the IRRS is intended to measure the",1
stress associated with everyday racism as uniquely experi-,1
"enced by African Americans, would it effectively discrim-",1
inate between Blacks and non-Blacks?,0
,0
"On the basis of a review of the literature (Essed, 1990;",0
"Feagin & Sikes, 1994; Jones, 1972), an examination of",0
"existing measures of racism (RDI; Terrell & Miller, 1980;",0
"RRS; Thompson et al., 1990; PRS; McNeilly et al., in press;",0
"RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994), and a pilot study, we anticipated",0
that the IRRS would sample the multidimensionality of,0
"racism. More specifically, on the basis of the pilot study and",0
the model of racism posited by Jones (1972) and later,0
"expanded on by Essed (1990), we hypothesized that the",0

principal-component structure of the IRRS would produce a,0
three- or four-component model. Using one of the racism,0
"measures currently in existence (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994;",0
"see Instruments), the researchers also hypothesized that the",0
IRRS and the RaLES-B would be positively correlated on,0
"measures representing comparable domains of racism (i.e.,",0
RaLES-B Group and the IRRS' measure of cultural racism),0
as well as their global measures of racism. It was also,0
hypothesized that the IRRS subscales and global measure,0
would be positively correlated with another measure of,0
"stress (PSS; Cohen, Karmarck, & Mermelstein, 1983; see",0
"Instruments). Finally, the researchers hypothesized that the",0
"IRRS would discriminate between Blacks and non-Blacks,",0
with Blacks having higher indicators of race-related stress.,0
,0
General Method,0
,0
Item Development,0
,0
The development of the initial items included on the IRRS was,0
based on informal interviews with African Americans from diverse,0
"backgrounds (both men and women), a review of the literature, and",0
the personal life experiences of the primary researcher (a male,0
African American). Efforts were made to ensure that the items,0
could be easily understood by someone reading at the eighth-grade,0
level or higher. The researchers reviewed all potential items for,0
"redundancy, and those found to be repetitious were eliminated",0
"from the scale. On the basis of these procedures, a total of 74 items",0
were generated and placed on a 5-point Likert-type scale. If an,0
"individual was the victim of a racist or discriminatory act, they",0
were to indicate their reaction to the event on the basis of the,0
"following response choices: 1 = no reaction, 2 = irritation, 3 =",0
"anger, 4 = hostility, 5 = rage. Individuals were to respond only to",0
"those events that they experienced, leaving the ones they did not",0
experience blank.,0
,0
Content Validity,0
,0
"To aid in assessing the content validity of the IRRS, a focus",0
group composed of 5 African Americans was facilitated by the,0
primary researcher for approximately 2,0
,0
x,0
h hr. In addition to eval-,0
,0
"uating the content validity of the IRRS, it was examined for its",0
efficiency of administration and any potential harmful effects that,0
might result from its completion. The group members completed,0
"the IRRS and a discussion concerning its structure, item clarity,",0
"item domain appropriateness, and the comprehensiveness of the",0
scale ensued.,0
,0
"As a result of the focus group, concerns were raised that resulted",0
"in several changes being made to the IRRS. First, the original",0
5-point Likert-type scale (1 = no reaction; 2 = irritation; 3 =,0
"anger; 4 = hostility; and 5 = rage), on which group members",0
found it difficult to differentiate between several of the response,0
"choices (i.e., anger, hostility, and rage), was changed (1 = unaf-",0
fected by the event; 2 = slightly bothered by the event; 3 = event,0
was upsetting; and 4 = extremely upset by event) to allow respon-,0
"dents to more clearly distinguish between their reactions. Second,",0
some of the events were ambiguous and needed clarification.,0
"Third, the group pointed out that several significant events fitting",0
"the criteria for inclusion were omitted (i.e., events relating to the",0
race-sex dynamic).,0
,0
"In addition to the focus group, five individuals (who were not",0
part of the focus group) with extensive research backgrounds on,0
,0
"racial-ethnic, gender, and cultural issues examined the IRRS items",0
"for their clarity and domain appropriateness. Each expert judge,",0
"who was a published scholar in the topical area, rated the items on",0
the IRRS using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = confusing; 2 =,0
ambiguous; 3 = fairly clear; and 4 = very clear) to indicate the,0
item's clarity. The domain appropriateness of each item was rated,0
as yes or no. Those items receiving a mean rating of less than 3.0,0
on item clarity were either rewritten or eliminated. Items rated as,0
not being domain appropriate were likewise rewritten or elimi-,0
nated. The net result was an initial IRRS version consisting of 67,0
"items with a total score range of 1 to 268, with higher scores",0
indicating a greater severity of race-related stress.,0
,0
Pilot Study,0
,0
Following the item development and content validity studies of,0
"the IRRS, a pilot study was conducted with 377 participants from",0
various geographic locations throughout the United States. The,0
sample consisted of 203 women and 163 men (11 missing gender,0
"variables) with ages ranging from 17 to 57, with a mean age of",0
22.65 years (SD = 6.85). One purpose of the pilot study was to,0
"determine the logistics of the IRRS's administration, such as the",0
"time it takes to complete, the readability and clarity of the items,",0
"the clarity of the IRRS instructions, and the content validity of the",0
"IRRS items, with a sample of participants similar in demographic",0
background to the target population. Another purpose of the pilot,0
study was to conduct a preliminary examination of the IRRS's,0
factor structure for an informal comparison to Jones's (1972),0
three-tier model of racism and Essed's (1990) four-tier model.,0
,0
"Based on the results of the pilot study, several changes were",0
"made to the IRRS. Foremost, it was discovered that during the",0
pilot study many of the questionnaires were incorrectly completed.,0
The researchers suspected that requiring participants to check,0
"some items, while leaving others blank, was confusing. As a result,",0
a new Likert-type scale on which no items are left blank was,0
designed (0 = This has never happened to me; 1 = This event,0
"happened, but did not bother me; 2 = This event happened and I",0
was slightly upset; 3 = This event happened and I was upset; 4 =,0
This event happened and I was extremely upset). This response,0
rating scale is consistent with those used on other stress-related,0
"measures (i.e., Daily Hassles Scale; Kanner, Coyne, Schafer, &",0
"Lazarus, 1980; Perceived Stress Scale, Cohen et al., 1983; Ways of",0
"Coping Scale, Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).",0
,0
"Using only those surveys that were completed correctly, a",0
principal-components analysis was performed on all 67 items of,0
the IRRS. This procedure yielded 17 factors with eigenvalues of,0
"greater than 1.0. However, a scree test (Cattell, 1965) indicated",0
"that as many as four factors were interpretable. Consequently, the",0

"judgment. Thus, the current version of the IRRS comprised 59",0
items in total.,0
,0
Study 1,0
,0
The purpose of Study 1 was to determine the principal-,0
component structure of the revised IRRS by conducting a,0
second principal-components analysis. In addition to deter-,0
"mining the component structure of the IRRS, indexes of",0
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) were computed for,0
each of the components extracted during this study. Fur-,0
"thermore, Pearson's product-moment correlation coeffi-",0
cients were calculated to determine the relationship between,0
the IRRS subscales.,0
,0
The IRRS is intended for use with individuals identifying,0
themselves as African American. As the IRRS is intended,0
"for use with African American adults in general, the re-",0
searchers attempted to sample a heterogeneous population,0
for Study 1. Only those individuals over the age of 17 were,0
"included in this study, as the scale is designed to measure",0
"race-related stress in African American adults. Moreover,",0
"various geographic regions, educational levels, and socio-",0
economic levels are represented in the sample.,0
,0
Method,0
,0
Sample. The total sample for Study 1 included 302 participants,0
"from Greensboro, NC, and New York City. In an effort to obtain",0
"a sample demographically similar to the target population, partic-",0
ipants were selected from a variety of settings: colleges and,0
"universities, a substance abuse treatment facility, and the commu-",0
nity at large. It is significant to note that there were no incorrectly,0
completed surveys in this study. There were approximately 10,0
surveys that were incomplete or suspected of being invalid. A total,0
"of 7 individuals refused to participate, primarily non-Blacks who",0
found the material offensive. Participants in Study 1 did not take,0
part in the pilot study.,0
,0
"Of the 302 participants in Study 1, 167 (55%) were female and",0
115 (38%) were male (19 missing values). Their ages ranged from,0
"18 to 61 years, with a mean age of 26.77 (SD = 9.02). The sample",0
included 90% American-born Blacks (8% represent Caribbean-,0
"born Blacks; 2% = missing values). Geographically, the sample",0
included 188 participants from the New York City region and 113,0
"from North Carolina (1 missing value). Of the entire sample, 35%",0
"were from the community at large, 51 % were college students, and",0
13% were residents in a substance abuse treatment facility. The,0
"marital status of the sample included 76% single, 13% married, 5%",0
"separated, and 1% widowed. For the entire sample, 29% were",0
"employed, with 17% earning between $10,000 and $25,000 annu-",0
"ally, and 28% earning below $10,000. Only 10% of those em-",0
"ployed earned more than $25,000 annually. The sample's mean",0
years of education was 13.79.,0
,0
Procedure. In cases in which the IRRS was sent away for data,0
"collection, it was administered by doctoral-level proctors who had",0
been thoroughly briefed in the proper protocol for its administra-,0
"tion. In all other cases, the primary researcher was responsible for",0
administration of the questionnaires. The survey was completed,0
"anonymously, and participation was on a voluntary basis. Each",0
survey included a cover letter and demographic questionnaire. In,0
,0
the cover letter a statement was issued to the effect that by,0
"completing the questionnaire, informed consent could be assumed.",0
"The survey generally took 20 to 30 min to complete, dependent on",0
the average reading ability of the group.,0
,0
The recruitment of participants was aided by a lottery held as an,0
incentive for participation in the study. Individuals who agreed to,0
"participate were given a lottery number, and a drawing was held at",0
the conclusion of each data collection session. The winner received,0
a $25 cash prize. The participants were debriefed individually or in,0
groups following the collection of data.,0
,0
Results,0
,0
IRRS component structure. A principal-components,0
analysis was again performed on all items of the IRRS. This,0
time the procedure yielded 15 components with eigenvalues,0
"of greater than 1.0. Once more, a scree test (Cattell, 1965)",0
indicated that as many as four components were interpret-,0
"able. As a result, one-, two-, three-, and four-component",0
extractions were forced using both an oblique and orthog-,0
onal rotation method. For this study the most interpretable,0
"of the four extractions, and the one conceptually supported",0
"by the literature (see Essed's, 1990, Collective Racism as an",0
"extension of the three-tier model proposed by Jones, 1972),",0
was the four-component orthogonal solution.,0
,0
The four-component orthogonal solution accounted for,0
"38% of the common variance, as did the oblique solution,",0
but the orthogonal solution loaded items to components that,0
were consistently more logical than the oblique. The criteria,0
for retaining items to the scale were as follows: (a) items,0
were required to have a component loading of .40 or higher,0
"to be selected, and (b) items meeting the .40 criteria must",0
also have been at least .15 greater than all other items,0
loading on the same component. See Table 1 for IRRS,0
"items, component loadings, communalities, and item means",0
and standard deviations.,0
,0
Component 1 (eigenvalue = 13.36) was responsible for,0
"23% of the common variance, with 16 items loading on this",0
component. These items represent the experience of racism,0
on a cultural level. Component 2 (eigenvalue = 4.58) was,0
"responsible for 8% of the common variance, with 11 items",0
meeting the selection criteria. For the most part these items,0
represent the experience of racism on an institutional level.,0
Component 3 (eigenvalue = 2.45) accounted for 4% of the,0
"common variance, with 11 items meeting the criteria for",0
selection. The general theme of these items relates to the,0
experience of racism on an individual level. Component 4,0
(eigenvalue = 2.06) accounted for 3% of the common,0
"variance, with 8 items meeting the criteria for selection. The",0
"concept of collective racism, an extension of individual",0
"racism (Essed, 1990), accounts for the general theme of this",0
component.,0
,0
Internal consistency and subscale inter correlations.,0
The coefficient alphas for the new IRRS subscales were .87,0
"for Component 1, Cultural Racism; .85 for Component 2,",0
"Institutional Racism; .84 for Component 3, Individual Rac-",0
"ism; and .79 for Component 4, Collective Racism.",0

Study 2,0
,0
A second study was conducted to examine other forms of,0
"construct validity for the IRRS. First of all, a confirmatory",0
factor analysis (CFA) of the IRRS component structure was,0
conducted. A CFA is an effective and powerful method for,0
investigating the construct validity of a measure (Rahim &,0
"Magner, 1995). Also, in an effort to establish the concurrent",0
"validity of the Index of Race-Related Stress, we adminis-",0
tered simultaneously a second measure of the perceived,0
stressful magnitude of racism and discrimination,0
(RaLES-B) as well as a second measure of perceived stress,0
"(Perceived Stress Scale). Furthermore, we used the group-",0
"differences method (see Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) for es-",0
tablishing construct validity by comparing IRRS subscale,0
scores for Blacks with the scores of a subsample of non-,0
"Blacks (Whites and Asians; n = 31). Moreover, indexes of",0
internal consistency for the IRRS subscales were again,0
calculated.,0
,0
Method,0
,0
"Sample. The total sample size for Study 2 was 341 participants,",0
including a subsample of 31 non-Blacks used for the group-,0
comparison validity procedure. The non-Black subsample was not,0
included in any data analysis other than the group-comparison,0
"procedure. In this study, as with the previous one, participants",0
"were selected from colleges, universities, and the community at",0
"large. Again, there is representation of African Americans from a",0
"wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, geographic regions,",0
and educational levels.,0
,0
"For Blacks exclusively, the total sample size in Study 2 was 310.",0
"Of this number, 207 (67%) were female and 92 (30%) were male.",0
"Their ages ranged from 17 to 76 years, with a mean age of 23.38",0
(SD = 7.74). This sample included 87% American-born Blacks,0
(12% represent Caribbean-born Blacks; missing values = 4). Geo-,0
"graphically, the sample for Study 2 included 153 participants from",0
"Washington, DC, and 157 from New York City. Of the entire",0
"sample, 16% were from the community at large and the remainder",0
were college students representing various colleges and universi-,0
ties in the Northeast. The marital status of the sample was 85%,0
"single, 9% married, 3% separated, 2% divorced, and 6% widowed.",0
"For participants in the community sample, 6.7% were employed.",0
"Of this group the annual income was $10,000 or less for the",0
majority of participants. The mean years of education for the,0
community-at-large sample was 12.39.,0
,0
"In the non-Black subsample (n = 31), there were 23 Whites and",0
8 Asians. The non-Black subsample had an age range of 19 to 47,0
"years, with a mean of 27.97 (SD = 7.64). There were 16 women",0
(55%) and 15 men (45%). The mean for years of education in the,0
non-Black subsample was 13.74 (SD = 3.97). The marital status of,0
"the subsample was 78% single, 16% married, and 6% divorced.",0
The majority of participants in the non-Black subsample also had,0
"an annual income level below $10,000.",0
,0
Instruments. The RaLES-B is a self-report measure that sam-,0
ples the minority group members' perceptions of the impact of,0
racism on their lives. Part I of the scale produces a Perceived,0
"Racism—Self total score and consists of 20 items, with a range",0
from 0-80. Part II produces a Perceived Racism—Group total,0
"score and consists of 12 items, with a range from 0-48. The",0
"RaLES, in a study on the adaptive functioning of African Amer-",0
"ican adolescents (Wells, 1995), was reported to have a Cronbach's",0
,0
alpha of .88 for the Racism—Self subscale and .90 for the,0
"Racism—Group subscale. In addition, Racism—Self was signifi-",0
cantly correlated with the Immersion dimension of racial identity,0
"(r = .26, p < .01) and with adaptive functioning (r = .18, p <",0
.05). Racism—Group was significantly correlated with both the,0
"Encounter (r = .23, p < .01) and Internalization (r = .29, p < .01)",0
dimensions of racial identity development. In the current study the,0
RaLES-B Self and Group subscales had Cronbach alphas of .90,0
"and .83, respectively (n = 55).",0
,0
The Perceived Stress Scale is a 14 item Likert-type (item re-,0
sponse scale = 0-4) self-report measure of the degree to which,0
one views situations in his or her life as stressful. The PSS was,0
designed to assess the degree to which people find events in their,0
"lives to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading. PSS",0
scores are calculated by first reversing the scores on 7 positive,0
items and then summing across all 14 items. In one study (Cohen,0
"et al., 1983), the PSS was found to correlate positively and sig-",0
nificantly with Life Events Scores among two separate college,0
"samples (.20 to .35, p < .01). Cohen et al. (1983) reported",0
Cronbach alphas of .84 and .85 for the two college samples and .86,0
for a smoking cessation sample. The PSS had a 2-day test-retest,0
correlation of .85 and a .55 correlation after 6 weeks. In the current,0
"study, the PSS had a Cronbach's alpha of .70 (n = 51).",0
,0
Procedure. A new sample of participants was recruited for,0
"Study 2, of which most were participating on a volunteer basis, the",0
"exception being one group of college students (n = 153), who",0
received extra class credit for participation. In administering the,0
"IRRS, the same procedures as followed in the previous studies",0
were repeated. Participants were again debriefed individually or in,0
groups following the questionnaire's administration. All partici-,0
pants except those in the non-Black subsample were given the,0
same instructions for completing the IRRS. The non-Black sub-,0
"sample was instructed to replace ""Black"" with their own racial",0
"group identity; for example, instead of reading the item ""you were",0
"treated with less respect because you are Black,"" it would be ""you",0
"were treated with less respect because you are White (or Asian).""",0
,0
"As previously noted, two additional instruments were adminis-",0
tered simultaneously with the IRRS to two separate subsamples for,0
the purpose of establishing the scale's concurrent validity. The first,0
"subsample (n = 51) received the PSS, randomly distributed over",0
the entire sample of Study 2. The second subsample (n = 57),0
received the RaLES-B. These were also randomly distributed over,0
"the entire sample. For the RaLES-B, the sequence in which the",0
surveys were administered was alternated to control for instrumen-,0
"tation effects. However, the PSS was always placed before the",0
IRRS in its order in the survey package to prevent the participants,0
from being influenced in their responses to the PSS by the nature,0
of the IRRS items.,0

Confirmatory factor analysis. A confirmatory factor,0
"analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 46 items of the IRRS,",0
using the LISREL 7 computer program (Joreskog & Sor-,0
"bom, 1989). Comparisons were made between the identified",0
"four-component orthogonal model, a four-component",0
"oblique model, a global component model, and a null",0
model. Several indexes assessing the degree to which the,0
model fits the data were computed by the researchers for all,0
"four competing models. First, a chi-square statistic was",0
"computed for each of the models, including the null. It is",0
important to note that the chi-square statistic tends to be,0
affected by large sample sizes and will likely produce a,0

"(Bentler & Bonett, 1980). In addition, significant chi-",0
squares will occur with models that have numerous vari-,0
"ables and high degrees of freedom (Bryant & Yarnold,",0
1995).,0
,0
By referring to Table 2 for a complete summary of the,0
"results of the confirmatory factor analysis, it will be ob-",0
served that the chi-square statistic for all four competing,0
"models was significant, suggesting an unsatisfactory fit.",0
"Additionally, as indicated by all indexes used in this study",0
"to evaluate the fit of the competing models, the four-",0
component oblique model had the greatest degree of fit,0
across all measures. The four-component oblique model,0
was the best fit because it had the lowest x2 value,0
"(1,865.24), the highest goodness-of-fit index (GFI; .78) and",0
"adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI; .76), the lowest -^Idf",0
"value (1.89), the lowest root mean square residual (RMSR;",0
".080), and the highest relative noncentrality index (RNI;",0
".80). The RNI is also independent of sample size, and",0
"according to Gerbing and Anderson (1993), the best avail-",0
able measure for determining the fit of structural equation,0
models.,0
,0
"Looking closely at these values, we would evaluate the",0
general fit of the proposed model as unsatisfactory. More,0
"desirable fits have, for example, the GFI in the high .80s and",0
".90s. According to Bagozzi and Heatherton (1994), it is",0
common for measurement models to have an unsatisfactory,0
fit when more than four or five items represent each com-,0
ponent and the sample size is large. The poor fit in these,0
cases is likely to be related to several factors: (a) the,0
"complexity of the models, (b) high levels of random error to",0
"be found in a scale with many items, and (c) the many",0
parameters to be estimated. One method that has been,0
"recommended (see Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994; Rahim &",0
"Magner, 1995) to address this problem is to sum items",0
"within each component, thus creating aggregate variables",0
that represent parallel indicators of the construct being,0
measured by the items. Items with the highest component,0
loadings are paired with items having the lowest component,0
"loading in sequential order in which the first, second, and",0
third highest loadings are paired with their corresponding,0
"lowest loadings, whereas the remaining items are randomly",0
"distributed among the new indicator variables (see Mathieu,",0
1991). After the items have been aggregated to form new,0
"and fewer indicators of the same construct, they are reen-",0
,0
tered into the LISREL 7 program and subjected to a second,0
confirmatory factor analysis.,0
,0
Using the method recommended by Bagozzi and Heath-,0
"erton (1994) and Rahim and Magner (1995), the authors",0
created the following aggregate variables to be reanalyzed,0
"using the LISREL 7 program: Cultural Racism 1 (Items 2,",0
"15, 31, & 3); Cultural Racism 2 (Items 40, 44, 43, & 34);",0
"Cultural Racism 3 (Items 8, 29, 21, & 35); Cultural Racism",0
"4 (Items 13, 42, 23, & 37); Institutional Racism 1 (Items 18",0
"& 46); Institutional Racism 2 (Items 12, 26, & 19); Insti-",0
"tutional Racism 3 (Items 20,45, & 39); Institutional Racism",0
"4 (Items 32,41, & 38); Individual Racism 1 (Items 9 & 33);",0
"Individual Racism 2 (Items 22, 30, & 4); Individual Racism",0
"3 (Items 5, 17, & 27); Individual Racism 4 (Items 1, 24, &",0
6); Collective Racism 1 (Items 14 & 16); Collective Racism,0
2 (Items 10 & 36); Collective Racism 3 (Items 7 & 25);,0
Collective Racism 4 (Items 11 & 28). Because these aggre-,0
gated variables represent new items of the same compo-,0
"nents, Cronbach's alphas were again calculated. For Cul-",0
"tural Racism, Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and",0
"Collective Racism, the Cronbach alpha was .86, .77, .83,",0
"and .75, respectively.",0
,0
On review of the second confirmatory factor analysis,0
"results found in Table 3, it will be observed that the fit",0
indexes for the four-component 16 aggregate variables im-,0
proved. The GFIs and AGFIs for both the orthogonal and,0
"oblique models ranged from .78 to .90 and .71 to .86,",0
respectively. The RNIs for the orthogonal and oblique mod-,0
"els ranged from .74 to .92, respectively. Although a better fit",0
for the proposed model (orthogonal) would have been de-,0
"sirable, the primary objective of this study was to find the",0
best fit for the data among the competing models. Accord-,0
"ing to Bryant and Yarnold (1995), the most common use of",0
"a confirmatory factor analysis is to determine ""whether a",0
"particular factor model fits the data better than others"" (p.",0
"119). Consequently, and in contradiction to the hypothe-",0
"sized model (four-component orthogonal model), the four-",0
component oblique model demonstrated the best overall fit,0
among the competing component models in this study (see,0
Table 3). That the four-component oblique model is the best,0
fit is not surprising given the moderate correlations found,0
between some subscales of the IRRS.,0

the IRRS subscales was determined to be sufficiently ade-,0

Discussion,0
,0
The current research sought to develop and validate a,0
paper-and-pencil self-report instrument that measures the,0
stress associated with the experience of racism in the daily,0
lives of African Americans. The theoretical framework un-,0
derlying the development of this measure was based on an,0
integration of the daily-hassles concept of stress (Lazarus &,0
"Folkman, 1984) and the multidimensional conceptualization",0
of everyday racism posited by Essed (1990). The net result,0
"of the preliminary phase of this study was a 46-item, self-",0
"report instrument, intended for use with African American",0
adults from a wide range of demographic backgrounds.,0
,0
A principal-components analysis and a confirmatory fac-,0
tor analysis supported a four-component structure as best,0
representing the experiences of racism in the daily lives of,0
African Americans. The four subscales of the IRRS repeat-,0
edly demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliabilities,0
"over two separate studies. In addition, the subscale inter-",0
correlations were low to moderate across the two studies.,0
"Moreover, the four subscales of the IRRS proved to be",0
consistent with Essed's (1990) conceptual model of every-,0
day racism; the following domains were represented by the,0
,0
"four-component structure: (a) cultural, (b) institutional, (c)",0
"individual, (d) collective.",0
,0
Initial evidence for the concurrent validity of the IRRS,0
subscales was established by using a second measure of,0
racism (RaLES-B) and a second measure of perceived,0
stress (PSS). Both the Self and Group subscales of,0
RaLES-B provided support for the concurrent validity of,0
the ERRS by positively and significantly correlating with,0
"several of its subscales. The RaLES-B Group subscale, as",0
"hypothesized, correlated positively and significantly with",0
"the Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, and Individual",0
Racism subscales of the ERRS. The RaLES-B Self subscale,0
was significantly correlated (in a positive direction) with the,0
"Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Collective",0
"Racism subscales of the ERRS. In addition, the IRRS Global",0
Racism measure was positively and significantly correlated,0
with the RaLES-B Global Racism measure. The fact that no,0
correlation was found between the RaLES-B Self subscale,0
and the Cultural Racism subscale of the IRRS is logical,0
given the divergent manifestations associated with these,0
two types of racism.,0
,0
"In a second correlational study, the PSS, as hypothesized,",0
correlated positively and significantly with the Cultural,0
"Racism, Individual Racism, and a Global Racism measure",0
of the ERRS. The lack of a significant correlation between,0
the PSS and the other subscales of the IRRS might be,0
"explained by several factors. For example, encounters with",0
institutional racism are likely to be less frequent than expo-,0
"sure to cultural racism, and better concealed by the perpe-",0
trator or perpetrators than the direct encounters of individual,0
racism. The lack of a significant correlation of the Collec-,0
tive Racism measure and the PSS might be explained by the,0
extreme nature of these events and their low rate of inci-,0
dence among the current sample.,0

discrimination during the test-retest interval is reduced. On,0
"the other hand, the sample from the adult education program",0
"were exposed to events, including racism and discrimina-",0
"tion, that might normally be experienced by African Amer-",0
icans in their daily contact with Whites and other non-,0
Blacks.,0
,0
A potential criticism of the IRRS relates to the absence of,0
a time frame in which the participants are requested to recall,0
the occurrence of an event relating to racism or discrimina-,0
"tion, or both, that they have experienced. The question",0
arises in this circumstance as to how accurate one can,0
remember his or her reaction to an event that occurred,0
"several months ago, or even several years in the past.",0
"However, assessing the stressful impact of African Ameri-",0
cans' experiences with racism is best served by not restrict-,0
ing the period of time in which it occurred; for as Feagin,0
"and Sikes (1994) suggested, the effects of such traumatic",0
experiences are long lasting. Another potential criticism of,0
the IRRS and an ongoing issue in the field of stress research,0
relates to the potential confound between the occurrence of,0
race-related events and the intensity of such experiences.,0
Because participants who have not experienced a given,0
"event are requested to select a response of 0, and those who",0
have had a given experience must select a response between,0
"1 and 4, it might be argued that the two responses are",0
measures of separate constructs and should be analyzed,0
"separately. This is a debatable issue (J. E. Holm, personal",0
"communication, April 22, 1996; R. S. Lazarus, personal",0
"communication, April 30, 1996), and it continues to be",0
"deliberated between the major camps (i.e., daily hassles and",0
stressful life events proponents) of stress researchers and,0
can by no means be solved within the limits of this study.,0
"For all practical purposes, and consistent with the work of",0
Lazarus and his colleagues (on which this study is in part,0
"based), not having experienced an event results in a stress",0
score of 0 and is viewed within the realm of a scoring,0
continuum of 0 to 4 (see Daily Hassles Scale [Revised] by,0
"Holm & Holroyd, 1992; Ways of Coping Scale by Lazarus",0
"& Folkman, 1984).",0
,0
The current findings suggest that the IRRS is a reliable,0
and valid measure of the multidimensional aspects of race-,0
related stress that African Americans potentially experience,0
in their daily lives. The IRRS can be used in assessing the,0
impact of racism and discrimination on the psychological,0
well-being of African American clients. Those providing,0
counseling services to this population can use the IRRS in,0
determining the need to address issues related to the client's,0
"experience with racism and discrimination. In addition, the",0
IRRS can be further studied for possible adaptation as a,0
semistructured clinical interview protocol that can be used,0
qualitatively by counseling psychologists in serving an Af-,0
rican American population. The research utility of the IRRS,0
is limitless and includes such topical areas as examining the,0
"therapy outcomes for African American clients, the impact",0
of racism on the racial identity development of African,0
"Americans, racism and its relation to the life satisfaction of",0
"African Americans, and the impact of racism on vocational",0
choices and academic outcomes.,0
