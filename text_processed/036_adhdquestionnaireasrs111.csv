The questions on the back page are designed to stimulate dialogue between you and your patients and to help,0
confirm if they may be suffering from the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).,0

Description:  The Symptom Checklist is an instrument consisting of the eighteen DSM-IV-TR criteria.,0
Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most predictive of symptoms consistent with,0
ADHD.  These six questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1 Screener and are also Part A of the,0
Symptom Checklist.  Part B of the Symptom Checklist contains the remaining twelve questions.,0

1. Ask the patient to complete both Part A and Part B of the Symptom Checklist by marking an X,0
in the box that most closely represents the frequency of occurrence of each of the symptoms.,0
,0
,0
,0
,0
2. Score Part A.  If four or more marks appear in the darkly shaded boxes within Part A then the,0
patient has symptoms highly consistent with ADHD in adults and further investigation is,0
warranted.,0

3. The frequency scores on Part B provide additional cues and can serve as further probes into the,0
patient’s symptoms.  Pay particular attention to marks appearing in the dark shaded boxes.  The,0
frequency-based response is more sensitive with certain questions.  No total score or diagnostic,0
likelihood is utilized for the twelve questions. It has been found that the six questions in Part A,0
are the most predictive of the disorder and are best for use as a screening instrument.,0

Checklist may also aid in the assessment of impairments.  If your patients have frequent,0

"to work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people such as their",0

"ADHD need not have been formally diagnosed in childhood.  In evaluating a patient’s history,",0
look for evidence of early-appearing and long-standing problems with attention or self-control.,0
"Some significant symptoms should have been present in childhood, but full symptomology is not",0
necessary.,0

The Value of Screening for Adults With ADHD,0

"Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant",0
"impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of your patients who may",0
"suffer from it.1-4 Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not",0
"receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the",0
"problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults.",0
,0
The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist was developed,0
"in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Workgroup on Adult",0
ADHD that included the following team of psychiatrists and researchers:,0

"As a healthcare professional, you can use the ASRS v1.1 as a tool to help screen for ADHD in",0
adult patients. Insights gained through this screening may suggest the need for a more in-depth,0
clinician interview. The questions in the ASRS v1.1 are consistent with DSM-IV criteria and,0
address the manifestations of ADHD symptoms in adults. Content of the questionnaire also,0
"reflects the importance that DSM-IV places on symptoms, impairments, and history for a correct",0
diagnosis.4,0
,0
The checklist takes about 5 minutes to complete and can provide information that is critical,0
to supplement the diagnostic process.,0
