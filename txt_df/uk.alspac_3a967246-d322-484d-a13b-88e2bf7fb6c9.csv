PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT,0
We would like to assess the stage of your daughter’s physical development using the,0
drawings on the next pages. These indicate various stages of puberty commonly used by,0
doctors to assess the growth and development of girls.,0
We need to know which drawings most closely match,0
your daughter’s stage of development at the moment.,0
Not all children follow the same pattern of development.,0
"Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.",0
If there are any additional comments about your daughter’s physical growth and development,0
"that you would like to make, then please do so here:",0

SECTION B,0
The drawings below show stages of the way the breasts develop. A girl can go through each,0
"of the five stages shown, although some girls skip some stages. Please look at each of the",0
drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions.,0
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is closest to your daughter’s current,0
breast stage.,0
This is the breast bud stage. In this stage the,0
nipple is raised more than in stage 1. The,0
breast is a small mound. The dark area,0
around the nipple (areola) is larger than in,0
stage 1.,0
The areola and the breast are both larger,0
than in stage 2. The areola does not stick,0
out away from the breast.,0
The areola and the nipple make up a mound,0
that sticks up above the shape of the breast.,0
(Note: This stage may not happen at all for,0
some girls. Some girls develop from stage 3,0
to stage 5 with no stage 4.),0
This is the mature adult stage. The breasts,0
are fully developed. Only the nipple sticks,0
out in this stage. The areola has moved,0
back in the general shape of the breast.,0

SECTION C,0
The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A girl can go through,0
each of the five stages shown. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read,0
the descriptions.,0
Put a tick in the box to the right of the drawing that is the closest to the amount of pubic hair,0
your daughter has.,0
Not sure,0
NOTE: Your daughter’s pubic hair stage may or may not be the same as her stage of,0
breast development.,0
There is no pubic hair,0
"There is a little long, lightly coloured hair. This",0
hair may be straight or a little curly.,0
The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser and,0
more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a,0
bigger area.,0
"The hair is now as dark, curly, and coarse as that",0
"of an adult woman. However, the area that the",0
hair covers is not as large as that of an adult,0
woman. The hair has not spread out to the legs.,0
The hair now is like that of an adult woman. It,0
also covers the same area as that of an adult,0
woman. The hair usually forms a triangular,0
pattern as it spreads out to the legs.,0
