Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ),0
The Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) was adapted from the,0
Physiological Reactions Questionnaire developed by Derryberry and Rothbart (1988).,0
"Based upon the results from recent studies (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000; Evans &",0
"Rothbart, 2007) we have formulated a self-report model of temperament that includes",0
"general constructs of effortful control, negative affect (which can be further divided into",0
"aggressive and nonaggressive negative affects) extraversion/surgency, orienting",0
"sensitivity, and affiliativeness.",0

Scoring Instructions for Evans & Rothbart (2007) ATQ long form,0
"Reversed (R) Items:  After the initial coding of the questionnaire, reversed items",0
"need to be reverse coded (i.e., a response of 1=7, 2=6, 3=5, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, and 7=1).",0
Items that are reversed are marked with an “R” next to their item number in the listing of,0
items by scale.,0
"Subscales/Subconstructs are listed in bold print.  To score the subscales, add all",0
of the Likert-responses within a given scale together and divide by the number of valid,0
item responses.,0
"General Scales/Constructs are listed in capitalized, underlined print.  To score",0
"general scales for the long form, add the AVERAGE Likert score from each subscale and",0
then divide by the total number of items belonging to that scale.,0
Item clusters are used to further differentiate the content of subscales and are,0
listed in italics.  Not all of the main-scales are divided into item clusters.  If particular,0
"item clusters are of interest, they can be scored in the same manner as the subscales.",0
"However, in most instances, it is likely that the main scales and/or factor scales will be",0
the variables of interest.,0
