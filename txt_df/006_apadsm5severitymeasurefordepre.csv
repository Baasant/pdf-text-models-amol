The APA is offering a number of “emerging measures” for further research and,0
clinical evaluation. These patient assessment measures were developed to be,0
administered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.,0
They should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to,0
enhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical,0
"diagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are",0
provided; further background information can be found in DSM-5. The APA,0
requests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the,0
instruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient,0

Instructions to Clinicians,0
The Severity Measure for Depression—Child Age 11–17 (adapted from PHQ-9 modified for Adolescents [PHQ-A]) is a 9-,0
item measure that assesses the severity of depressive disorders and episodes (or clinically significant symptoms of,0
depressive disorders and episodes) in children ages 11–17. The measure is completed by the child prior to a visit with,0
the clinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his or her depression symptoms during the past 7 days.,0
Scoring and Interpretation,0
Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Several days; 2=More than half the days; and,0
"3=Nearly every day). The total score can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.",0
The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw,0
score in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 9 items should be summed to obtain a total raw,0
score and should be interpreted using the table below:,0
Interpretation Table of Total Raw Score,0

5-9  Mild,0
10-14  Moderate,0
15-19,0
20-27,0
Moderately severe,0

"Note: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total raw score on the measure should not be used.  Therefore, the",0
"child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure.  If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered, you are",0
asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were,0
answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of items on the PHQ-9 modified,0
"for Adolescents (PHQ-A)—Modified (i.e., 9) and divide the value by the number of items that were actually answered",0
"(i.e., 7 or 8). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:",0

Number of items that were actually answered,0
"If the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.",0
Frequency of Use,0
"To track changes in the severity of the child’s depression over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals",0
"as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores",0
on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that might warrant further,0
"assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.",0
