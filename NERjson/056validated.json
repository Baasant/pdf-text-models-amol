The deleterious effect on the psychological health of African Americans that may result from everyday racism is significant and should be addressed by counseling psychologists and other mental health prac- titioners. When providing psychological services to African American clients, counselors can include an assessment, possibly during the intake process, of the extent to which racism and discrimination might be related to the client's presenting problem or problems, or in some way interfering with the client's current level of functioning (Smith, 1985). Consequently, there is a strong need for a self-administered, psychometrically sound (and relatively brief) measure of the magnitude and range of an individual's experiences with racism and discrimination (Outlaw, 1993).\r",{"entities":[[0,1155,"GARBAGE"]]}],["White, J.

The question arises in this circumstance as to how accurate one can remember his or her reaction to an event that occurred several months ago, or even several years in the past. However, assessing the stressful impact of African Ameri- cans' experiences with racism is best served by not restrict- ing the period of time in which it occurred; for as Feagin and Sikes (1994) suggested, the effects of such traumatic experiences are long lasting. Another potential criticism of the IRRS and an ongoing issue in the field of stress research relates to the potential confound between the occurrence of race-related events and the intensity of such experiences. Because participants who have not experienced a given event are requested to select a response of 0, and those who have had a given experience must select a response between 1 and 4, it might be argued that the two responses are measures of separate constructs and should be analyzed separately. This is a debatable issue (J. E. Holm, personal communication, April 22, 1996; R. S. Lazarus, personal communication, April 30, 1996), and it continues to be deliberated between the major camps (i.e., daily hassles and stressful life events proponents) of stress researchers and can by no means be solved within the limits of this study. For all practical purposes, and consistent with the work of Lazarus and his colleagues (on which this study is in part based), not having experienced an event results in a stress score of 0 and is viewed within the realm of a scoring continuum of 0 to 4 (see Daily Hassles Scale [Revised] by Holm & Holroyd, 1992; Ways of Coping Scale by Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).\r",{"entities":[[0,1881,"GARBAGE"]]}],["models (pp. 40-65).
