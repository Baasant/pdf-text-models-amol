The aim of this project is to learn about people’s saving behaviour in Australia’s retirement system. The survey you are about to undertake will ask you questions about your approach to your retirement planning. This research is supported by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Why have I been invited to participate? You have been invited to participate because you are a member of the Qualtrics survey panel. You can pull out at any time and it won’t change your relationship with PM&C, Treasury or anyone else. What will I need to do? We will ask you to complete a short survey asking about your pre-retirement plans and decisions around retiring. We expect it to take less than 15 minutes to complete. What will happen to my information? Your responses to the survey questions will remain completely anonymous, and you won’t be identified in any way. Your responses will only be used for research purposes unless required by law. In particular, your responses will be used to inform the current Retirement Income Review. Your data will be held securely by PM&C for at least 15 years. It may also be shared with other researchers to inform their work. What are the potential risks? We do not think there are any risks to participating in this research. Contact If you have any concerns or complaints about this research, please contact BETA at BETA@pmc.gov.au.
